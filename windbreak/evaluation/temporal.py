"""Temporal-integrity enforcement for the evaluation harness (SPEC-EPIC_07, #52).

This module makes training-data leakage into gate metrics *structurally*
impossible. The temporal coordinate is exclusively the monotonic integer
``sequence_number`` on the append-only ledger -- there is no wall-clock and no
float anywhere on the value path, only exact integer comparisons.

A forecast is rejected, at ingestion, when it cannot be an honest prediction:

    * ``PRE_DEPLOYMENT`` -- it has no recorded creation sequence, or its
      creation sequence is at or before the system's deployment sequence.
    * ``BACKDATED`` -- its market has a known resolution sequence ``r`` and the
      forecast was created at or after ``r`` (it could have peeked at the
      answer).
    * ``UNRESOLVED`` -- its market never resolved, so it can never enter a
      headline metric.

The three reasons are checked in exactly that precedence, so each rejected
record is ledgered with exactly one reason. Every rejection is recorded as an
immutable :class:`RejectionEvent` rather than silently dropped.

The intra-package dependency graph stays one-way and acyclic: this module
imports the dependency-free :mod:`windbreak.evaluation.resolution` leaf at
runtime and references :mod:`windbreak.evaluation.registry`'s carrier types only
under :data:`typing.TYPE_CHECKING`. Because it therefore cannot construct an
:class:`~windbreak.evaluation.registry.EvaluationInputs`, the reconstruction seam
that rebuilds admitted inputs lives in the registry, which imports this module
at runtime.
