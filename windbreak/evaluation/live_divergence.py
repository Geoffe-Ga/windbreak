"""Per-run live-vs-paper divergence monitor (issue #58, SPEC §10.9/§10.10).

:func:`monitor_live_divergence` scores the two live-divergence series --
``live_slippage_ratio`` (cost slippage of real fills vs the paper model) and
``live_brier_degradation`` (rolling LIVE-over-PAPER forecast-skill decay) --
against a pre-registered :class:`~windbreak.evaluation.preregistration.GatePlan`'s
thresholds, and turns a breach into a promotion-ladder demotion.

Every call appends exactly one :class:`LiveDivergenceSampled` (both series
values -- sentinels rendered by name -- thresholds, window size, cohort counts,
and ``plan_hash``), regardless of outcome. Each series that breaches its
threshold appends exactly one :class:`LiveDivergenceBreached` (the same snapshot
plus the firing trigger name), fires exactly one ``AlertSeverity.CRITICAL``
alert, and calls ``fire_trigger`` with the matching
:class:`~windbreak.riskkernel.demotion.DemotionTrigger`
(``LIVE_PAPER_SLIPPAGE_DIVERGENCE`` for slippage, ``ROLLING_BRIER_DEGRADATION``
for the Brier band). Both breaching in one run fires both triggers -- the
fail-safe "double one-rung demotion" reading -- never a single conflated event.

A PAPER-only run (no LIVE forecast, no execution record) yields both series
``UNDEFINED``, appends only the sampled event, and fires nothing: the demoability
tracer's ordinary early-deployment state. A recorded fill whose ``model_version``
disagrees with the plan's ``paper_fill_model_version`` fails closed
(:class:`ValueError`) before anything is ledgered.

The two typed events derive their base
:class:`~windbreak.ledger.events.Event` fields through a LOCAL
:func:`_derive_typed_event` (the house pattern from
:mod:`windbreak.evaluation.preregistration` / :mod:`windbreak.evaluation.crosscheck`),
so this issue never touches the ledger's central ``EVENT_TYPES`` map. Only the
leaf :class:`~windbreak.riskkernel.demotion.DemotionTrigger` is imported from the
risk-kernel package, keeping the edge thin.
