"""Shared component: the append-only, hash-chained ledger (SPEC S5.1).

Provides the tamper-evident event log every process writes to and that
Evaluation and the Dashboard read from. Events (:class:`ConfigLoaded`,
:class:`ModeHeartbeat`, :class:`AlertEmitted`) are appended to a
:class:`SqliteLedgerStore`, which chains each record's SHA-256 hash to its
predecessor so :meth:`SqliteLedgerStore.verify_chain` can detect any
single-column corruption. :func:`rebuild` folds a verified ledger into
derived read models.

Head-hash anchoring (issue #75) closes the one gap ``verify_chain`` cannot:
:func:`anchor_head` records the chain head to an append-only anchor file and
:func:`verify_anchors` flags any live chain that a tail rewrite has moved away
from its anchors (:class:`AnchorMismatchError`), failing closed on a missing or
malformed anchor file (:class:`AnchorFormatError`).

The Order Gateway / crash-recovery event vocabulary (issue #38-#40) lives here
too, so a persisted envelope can be reconstructed from :data:`EVENT_TYPES`
regardless of which package produced it: :class:`OrderTransitionLedgered`,
:class:`SubmissionRefused`, :class:`ReduceOnlyRefused`,
:class:`ReduceOnlyViolation`, :class:`ReconciliationHalted`,
:class:`ReconciliationHealed`, and :class:`RecoveryCompleted`.

Example:
    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>> store = SqliteLedgerStore(Path("ledger.db"))
    >>> event = ConfigLoaded(component="pipeline", config_hash="abc", diff={})
    >>> seq = store.append(event)
    >>> store.verify_chain()
    >>> store.close()
    >>> rebuild(Path("ledger.db"), Path("read_models"))
