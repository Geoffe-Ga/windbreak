"""Structural outbound-network allowlist for the live deployment (issue #57).

SPEC S5.2/S7.1 require a live (LIVE_MICRO/LIVE) deployment to be able to reach
only an explicit, small set of hosts -- the exchange, the forecast providers,
and the configured alert sink -- and *nothing else*. This module makes that
boundary **structural rather than advisory**, mirroring
:meth:`windbreak.forecast.sandbox.ResearchTools.fetch`: every outbound URL is
screened for parse-differential SSRF bytes and matched by exact, lowercased
hostname against a fixed allowlist before a connector may dial it.

:class:`OutboundAllowlist` fails closed: :meth:`~OutboundAllowlist.require`
*always* raises :class:`EgressDeniedError` on a denial, and only *additionally*
records an ``EgressDenied`` ledger event when a recorder is wired -- telemetry
never gates the refusal. :func:`allowlist_from_config` derives the host set from
a :class:`~windbreak.config.schema.WindbreakConfig`: the exchange host (by
provider/environment) and each forecast provider host. An unrecognized provider
contributes no host, so an unknown exchange or model can never silently inherit
network access.

Alert-sink hosts are deliberately *not* derived here: the SPEC S16
:class:`~windbreak.config.schema.AlertSink` schema carries only ``type``/
``topic`` (no ``base_url``), and SPEC S16 is canonical with unknown keys fatal,
so there is no config field to derive one from. An alert sink's host is instead
supplied at :class:`~windbreak.alerts.sinks.NtfySink` construction time via its
own explicit allowlist.

This module sits on the network boundary but off the money path; it is
float-free by construction (it does no arithmetic).
