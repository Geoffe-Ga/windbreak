"""SPEC S9.3 entry conditions gating a selector intent (issue #44).

:func:`evaluate_entry_conditions` renders the twelve pinned SPEC S9.3 named
conditions into a ``tuple[EntryCheck, ...]`` -- one check per name, in the fixed
evaluation order the ledger and the golden-determinism harness depend on. Each
condition is a small, branch-free helper reading only what it needs from the
:class:`~windbreak.selector.types.SelectorInputs` and the already-computed
:class:`~windbreak.selector.edge.EdgeFigures`; the aggregator assembles them in
order. The selector is pure and clock-free (SPEC S9.1), so every freshness
condition measures age against a *reference instant* derived from the inputs'
own timestamps -- ``T = max(order_book.fetched_at, forecast.created_at,
fee_model.as_of)`` -- never against ``datetime.now``. All temporal comparisons
are on :class:`~datetime.timedelta` objects, never their float
``.total_seconds()``. This module is on ``scripts/lint_no_floats.py``'s
denylist: no float, no bare ``/``.
