"""Fee-aware executable-edge arithmetic for the selector (SPEC S9.2, issue #44).

:func:`compute_executable_edge` walks a market's ``yes_asks`` best-first to the
requested size, prices the fill at its *executable* (size-weighted) cost -- never
the midpoint or a single level's quote -- and chains SPEC S9.2's five signed
ppm-of-$1-per-contract edge figures off it: gross, fee-adjusted, slippage-
adjusted, research-cost-adjusted, and the annualized expected return. When the
book cannot fill the size it returns :class:`InsufficientDepth` naming the
shortfall rather than raising, and when a fill prices but cannot be annualized
(a 0-pip price or a zero-hour forecast horizon would zero the annualization
denominator) it returns :class:`NonAnnualizable` -- so both a shallow book and
an undecidable fill are decidable non-entries, not crashes.

Unit bridge (the one place scales cross): a price is in pips (1e-4 $/contract)
and a size in centis (1e-2 contracts), so ``price.value * count.value`` is an
*exact* micros (1e-6 $) product with no remainder. A per-contract cost of
``total_micros`` over ``size_centis`` re-expressed in ppm-of-$1 is
``total_micros * 100 / size_centis`` (1 pip == 100 ppm), the sole role of
:data:`_PPM_PER_PIP`. Every division routes through
:func:`windbreak.numeric.divide` with an explicit conservative direction -- costs
:data:`~windbreak.numeric.RoundingDirection.OVERSTATE_COST` (ceiling, never
understate what a fill costs), the annualized return
:data:`~windbreak.numeric.RoundingDirection.UNDERSTATE_EQUITY` (floor toward
negative infinity, never overstate what a position earns). This module is on
``scripts/lint_no_floats.py``'s denylist: no float, no bare ``/``.
