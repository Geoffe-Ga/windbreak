"""Operating-mode state machine for the Risk Kernel (SPEC S5.1-S5.3).

The Risk Kernel advances through a seven-state ladder: the four promotable
runtime modes ``RESEARCH -> PAPER -> LIVE_MICRO -> LIVE`` (each reachable only
one rung at a time and only up to a configured ``mode_ceiling``), plus the
three always-reachable safety modes ``PAUSED``, ``HALT``, and ``KILLED``. Once
in ``KILLED`` the machine is a dead end: no ordinary transition escapes it, and
the only way back to ``RESEARCH`` is :meth:`ModeStateMachine.rearm` with an
exact typed-confirmation phrase.

The legal-transition rules are held in the module-level
:data:`_ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` table (a mapping of each source mode to the set of
targets legal *ignoring the ceiling*), so :meth:`ModeStateMachine.transition`
is a small, table-driven lookup plus a single dynamic ceiling check rather than
a sprawling branch tree.
