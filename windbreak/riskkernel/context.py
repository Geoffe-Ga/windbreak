"""The full evaluation context a Risk Kernel pre-trade check reads (SPEC S10).

Issue #30 promotes the 24 SPEC S10.3 checks from reading an
:class:`~windbreak.riskkernel.checks.OrderIntent` alone to reading an
:class:`EvaluationContext`: the intent *plus* everything a check needs to make
a real risk decision -- the operating mode, the configured risk limits, the
current account state, the market view, the fee upper bounds, and the wall
clock. The context is assembled from five frozen, slotted dataclasses so that:

    * each concern (limits vs. live account state vs. market data vs. fees)
      owns its own immutable value object, and
    * a check can be handed the whole context yet still only *read* it -- no
      check can mutate the state it is evaluating.

Every numeric field is a :mod:`windbreak.numeric` scaled-integer type (or a
plain ``int`` count / epoch second), never a float (SPEC S6.1). Optional
market and fee fields are ``None`` when the datum is unavailable, and a check
that depends on a ``None`` field fails closed (vetoes) rather than guessing.
