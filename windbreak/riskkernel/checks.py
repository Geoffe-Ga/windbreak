"""Pre-trade veto checks for the Risk Kernel (SPEC S10.3).

This module ships the 24 SPEC S10.3 pre-trade checks. Issues #30, #31, #32,
#34, and #110 give 23 of them real logic -- instrument whitelist, mode/ceiling,
the floor invariant, balance/position/open-order reconciliation (#32), fee-bound
presence, concentration, daily loss, trailing drawdown, velocity, quote/forecast
freshness, price band, participation cap, human-ack satisfaction (#34),
approval-token and idempotency-key uniqueness (#31), clock skew, exchange-status
and pipeline-heartbeat liveness (#110), and reduce-only provability -- each
reading a full :class:`EvaluationContext`. The remaining 1 is a deliberate stub
that still vetoes, naming the metadata it awaits (:data:`_STUB_REASONS`), so an
operator sees *why* a check is not yet live rather than a bare "not implemented".

Every check is a small, pure callable taking ``(intent, context)`` and
returning a :class:`CheckResult`; :func:`evaluate_intent` runs the whole
sequence fail-closed: a check that *raises* is converted into a veto reason
(``"{name}: error: {exc}"``) rather than propagating, and the checks after it
still run. The 24-check order is pinned by :data:`_SPEC_10_3_CHECK_NAMES`, and
:data:`DEFAULT_CHECKS` is assembled from a name-to-check table so that order can
never drift.
