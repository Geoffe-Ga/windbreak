"""Read-only exchange verification for the Risk Kernel (SPEC S5.2 / S10.3).

Each cycle the kernel cross-checks a read-only :class:`MarketConnector`'s
exchange-verified balances, positions, and open orders against
ledger-derived :class:`LedgerExpectations`, classifies the result as
:class:`VerificationOutcome` ``CLEAN`` / ``DRIFT_WITHIN_TOLERANCE`` / ``BREACH``,
fires an operator alert for any held market whose jurisdiction is unknown, fires
a reconciliation-mismatch alert on a breach, and records exactly one bare
:class:`~windbreak.ledger.events.Event` per cycle. The resulting
:class:`VerificationSnapshot` feeds both the kernel's HALT-on-breach path and
the floor computation (its observed cash and drift rewrite the account's
verified-cash and reconciliation-buffer terms).

Balance and position drift are tolerance-graded: a nonzero diff within tolerance
is drift (still ``ok``), a diff beyond tolerance is a breach. Open orders are
discrete, so any set difference at all is a breach. Every value on this path is
a :mod:`windbreak.numeric` scaled integer -- never a float (SPEC S6.1, enforced
by ``scripts/lint_no_floats.py``) -- and every recorded payload leaf is an
``int``, ``str``, or ``bool``.

:class:`KernelLedgerWriter` and :class:`MarketConnector` are imported under
``TYPE_CHECKING`` only: both are structural protocols, so importing them for
typing alone keeps this module free of a runtime ``verification`` <-> ``process``
import cycle.

    ``self._expectations``; every :meth:`get_expectations` call returns that same
    object, so a connector mutated after construction never changes the result
    (the freeze guarantee the verifier relies on).

    The projection is *scoped*, not a full venue reconstruction, because the
    ledger is not a complete record of intended venue state -- each dimension is
    ledger-seeded only where the ledger actually carries the fact, and otherwise
    falls back, independently, to the connector's own startup capture:

      ``"VerificationMismatch"`` is excluded so a restart never re-baselines onto
      a cash figure already known to breach. Fallback: the connector's available
      cash. A full reconstruction is impossible here because incremental fills
      and available-cash movements are not ledgered with amounts.
    * **positions** (ledger-seeded): the rows of the last
      ``PositionsSnapshotRecorded`` event. Fallback: the connector's positions.
    * **open orders** (startup-connector-captured): empty only while the history
      ends KILLED and unrearmed (a ``KillEngaged`` -- whose kill cancelled every
      resting order -- with no matching later ``KillReArmed``), otherwise the
      connector's resting-order ids. The killed-vs-rearmed decision reuses the
      kernel's one canonical kill fold
      (:func:`~windbreak.riskkernel.kill.kill_state_in`), so it can never
      disagree with the mode the kernel replays to; scoping it to the *current*
      kill (not any historical one) is what stops a past kill or routine
      kill/re-arm drill from permanently zeroing the expectation and turning
      every later legitimately-resting order into a false-positive breach. Open
      orders can never be ledger-*seeded* positively: venue order ids are never
      ledgered (``OrderTransitionLedgered`` carries only the client_order_id),
      so the ledger cannot name the resting orders a restart should expect.

    Bounded cross-restart residual: because the cash seed is the last non-breach
    verification cash, a within-tolerance drift persisted by a prior run's last
    clean/drift cycle becomes the next run's baseline, so tolerated drift can
    ratchet across restarts -- but only by at most one tolerance band per
    restart, since any move beyond tolerance is a breach and a breach event is
    never allowed to seed the baseline.
