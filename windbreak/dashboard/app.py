"""Stub localhost dashboard HTTP surface for Process D (SPEC S5.1, S14).

Serves a single authenticated status page on the loopback interface only.
Per SPEC S14 the dashboard accepts **no public inbound traffic**, so the bind
host is the hardcoded :data:`_BIND_HOST` (``127.0.0.1``) and is deliberately
*not* configurable -- there is no code path that binds any other interface.

Two dependency-injection seams are wired by successor issues: the dashboard
auth ``token`` is minted from configuration (issue #11), and the
``status_source`` callable will be backed by the read-only ledger view (issue
#13). Until then callers pass both explicitly, so this module has no ambient
dependency on either.
