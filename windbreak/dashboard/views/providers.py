"""Renderer for the dashboard's ``/providers`` fleet-observability panel (#195).

Renders the provider-panel read-model rows into an HTML section, mirroring
:mod:`windbreak.dashboard.views.decisions`'s pure-renderer idiom. Two row kinds
share one list (mirroring ``gateway_events.json``'s own multi-type-in-one
projection, discriminated by a ``kind`` key here): a ``"provider"`` row (one
per provider's summary line -- provider id, resolved count, Brier skill, canary
status, abstention rate, and the permanently ``n/a`` per-provider
``cost_per_forecast``, issue #281) and a ``"fleet"`` row (the two fleet-wide
cost figures that ARE derivable in aggregate).

Every ledger-derived value flows through
:func:`windbreak.dashboard.views._html.escape` before output -- provider
identifiers are operator-supplied config today but must stay defensively
escaped like every other dashboard-rendered string. A negative Brier skill is
rendered verbatim, in markup structurally identical to a positive one: the panel
never dims, omits, or conditionally styles a value based on its sign (the
honesty invariant).
