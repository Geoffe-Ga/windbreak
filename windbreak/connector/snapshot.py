"""The market-snapshot task and its event-ledger persistence seam.

:class:`MarketSnapshotTask` walks every market a connector offers and records,
per market, a ``MARKET_SNAPSHOT`` event (the market projected via
:func:`~windbreak.connector.models.market_to_payload`), then hands the market
and its order book to the injected screener via ``screen_book``. The screener --
not this task -- is the single ``SCREEN_DECISION`` emitter, writing to the same
shared ledger writer. Events flow through the :class:`EventLedgerWriter`
protocol -- a dependency-injection seam with no ``windbreak.ledger`` dependency,
mirroring :class:`windbreak.alerts.dispatch.LedgerWriter`. A broken writer is
isolated: its failure (whether raised by a snapshot write or by the screener's
own decision write) is logged and swallowed so one bad record can never abort a
run.
