"""Whole-ledger weekly-report fold for the always-on PAPER loop (issue #188).

:func:`weekly_report_body` folds an entire ``SqliteLedgerStore.read_all()``
result into a rendered weekly report, wiring *real*
:class:`~windbreak.evaluation.registry.EvaluationInputs` /
:class:`~windbreak.evaluation.registry.FixtureForecast`s and a real
:class:`~windbreak.evaluation.costs.CostMeter` in place of the #55
``evaluation=None, costs=None`` placeholder the scheduler wrote before.

Every ``ForecastCreated`` record folds into a :class:`FixtureForecast` with
``created_sequence`` sourced from the record's ``sequence_number``, its
``baseline_executable_price_pips`` and research cost read verbatim off the
payload, ``traded=False`` and ``live=False``. A whole-ledger fold has no
ground-truth resolutions available at all, so the fold always gates against an
empty ``resolutions`` and a ``TemporalContext`` with ``deployment_sequence=0``:
every folded forecast is temporally admitted (``created_sequence >= 1 > 0``) and
then rejected by the evaluation gate's own ``UNRESOLVED`` reason, landing in the
rendered report's ``== rejections ==`` ledger rather than silently vanishing.

A legacy (pre-#188, ``payload_schema_version == 1``) ``ForecastCreated`` row --
missing ``research_cost_micros`` / ``market_price_baseline_pips`` -- fails closed
with a :class:`ValueError` naming the missing key, never a silent zero-cost
default or a bare :class:`KeyError`.

Every value stays on the integer money/probability path (SPEC S6.1): this
package is on ``scripts/lint_no_floats.py``'s denylist.
