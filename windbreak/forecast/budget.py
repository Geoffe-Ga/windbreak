"""SPEC S8.4/S16 research budget enforcement and cost reporting.

The forecast engine spends real money on research; SPEC S16 caps that spend on
two axes -- a per-forecast micros ceiling and a per-UTC-day micros ceiling --
and bounds how many web pages a single forecast may fetch. :class:`ResearchBudget`
enforces all three fail-closed: :meth:`ResearchBudget.ensure_day_open` halts a
run *before any research* once the day bucket is exhausted, and
:meth:`ResearchBudget.charge_forecast` records a forecast's spend into the day
bucket *first* (so a breached forecast still counts against the day) before
raising on a per-forecast overrun. :func:`report_research_costs` summarizes
accumulated spend into per-resolved-forecast and per-profitable-trade unit
costs.

The three defaults deliberately mirror
:data:`windbreak.forecast.triage.PER_FORECAST_BUDGET_MICROS` and its siblings
rather than importing them: importing ``triage`` here would create a
``budget -> triage -> pipeline -> budget`` import cycle once ``pipeline`` grows a
budget seam, so the constants are restated locally.

Every decision is ledgered through the :class:`BudgetLedgerWriter` seam (modeled
verbatim on :class:`windbreak.forecast.triage.TriageLedgerWriter`) with
``int``/``str``/``bool`` payload leaves only -- never a float, per the
package-wide no-float convention ``scripts/lint_no_floats.py`` enforces. All
money math is integer-only, with the single per-unit division routed through
:func:`windbreak.numeric.rounding.divide` so its rounding direction is explicit.
