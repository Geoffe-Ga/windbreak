"""SPEC S8.4 two-stage triage with per-forecast cost ledgering.

The forecast engine spends most of its budget on the twelve-stage full pipeline
(:func:`windbreak.forecast.pipeline.run_pipeline`). SPEC S8.4 puts a cheap
Stage-0 *prior* in front of it: a single model call yields a rough
probability, and the expensive pipeline runs *only if* that prior diverges from
the executable-price baseline by at least the triage threshold (or an operator
flag / refresh forces it). When the prior stays within the band, the run stops
early and emits a schema-valid ``triage_only`` :class:`ForecastRecord` carrying
just the Stage-0 cost -- never a live-eligible record, since no research backed
it.

Every decision is ledgered through the :class:`TriageLedgerWriter` seam (a
dependency-injection point modeled on
:class:`windbreak.connector.snapshot.EventLedgerWriter`): a ``TRIAGE_STOP`` or
``TRIAGE_PROCEED`` :class:`TriageEvent` whose payload leaves are exact
``int``/``str``/``bool`` values -- never a float, per the package-wide no-float
convention ``scripts/lint_no_floats.py`` enforces. All arithmetic here is
integer-only for the same reason.

The PROCEED path additionally threads an optional
:class:`windbreak.forecast.pipeline.ForecastLedgerWriter` *discard* ledger into
the full pipeline, so a triage-path run ledgers discarded model outputs
identically to a direct :func:`windbreak.forecast.pipeline.run_pipeline` call.
This is a separate seam from the ``TriageLedgerWriter`` above (which records
only the STOP/PROCEED decision itself).
