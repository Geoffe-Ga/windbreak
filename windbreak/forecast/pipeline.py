"""SPEC S8.2 forecast pipeline wiring (offline, deterministic stub stages).

This module implements the twelve pipeline stages of SPEC S8.2 as discrete,
typed functions and threads them together in :func:`run_pipeline`. The spec's
S8.2 diagram (``plans/SPEC_v3.md:292-301``) reads as an eleven-arrow chain but
carries *twelve* arrow segments once the terminal
"schema-validated ForecastRecord" step is counted; the twelve stage functions
below map one-to-one onto those segments.

The stage bodies are deterministic, network-free stubs (identity and
fixture-derived logic) with real control flow -- the milestone is a correct,
byte-deterministic wiring skeleton, not modeled forecasting. Determinism is
load-bearing: ``created_at`` is injected (never ``datetime.now()``), all math
is integer-only, and :func:`collect_model_votes` is the sole stage that
touches the :class:`~windbreak.forecast.cassettes.LlmTransport` seam, so wiring
a :class:`~windbreak.forecast.cassettes.ForbiddenLiveTransport` (or an empty
replay cassette) fails the run closed rather than silently succeeding.

    Stage 5 reaches the web only through ``research_tools``, whose egress

    transport-class fault (timeout, rate-limit, HTTP, cost overrun) is caught

    charges the run's research cost (raising fail-closed on a per-forecast
    overrun). Given identical inputs

            quorum the run abstains :data:`ABSTENTION_ENSEMBLE_QUORUM_NOT_MET`

            member (keyword-only). ``None`` (the default) drives the pre-existing
            fixture-vote path byte-identically; a supplied factory instead drives
            each member through a caller's provider (e.g. an HTTP-backed

            :data:`PROVIDER_GATE_HELD_EVENT` when any voting provider is unproven,
            independently of the canary gate (never short-circuited). It never
            changes which votes run.

    Returns:
        The produced, immutable forecast record.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``min_ensemble_votes`` is below ``1``; a usage error
            rejected loudly before any stage runs.
        DailyBudgetExhaustedError: If ``budget`` is supplied and the run's UTC
            day is already exhausted; raised before any research.
        PerForecastBudgetExceededError: If ``budget`` is supplied and the run's
            research cost exceeds the per-forecast ceiling.
        TemporalIntegrityError: If ``calibration_map`` is supplied and trained
            after the forecast's own ``created_at`` (a future-dated map fails the
            whole run closed).
