"""The first, network-free :class:`ForecastProvider` implementation (SPEC S8.9).

:class:`FixtureVoteProvider` wraps an
:class:`~windbreak.forecast.cassettes.LlmTransport` (a fake, a recording
cassette, a replay cassette, or a forbidden-live transport) plus one ensemble
member. Its :meth:`~FixtureVoteProvider.forecast` builds the deterministic vote
request, obtains the raw completion, and screens it through
:func:`windbreak.forecast.sanitize.validate_vote_response`: a rejected response
raises :class:`ProviderResponseRejectedError` (fingerprint only, never the raw
text), while a clean one is parsed into a :class:`ProviderForecast` carrying the
parsed probability/rationale, the member's provenance, a zero fixture cost, no
citations, and a fingerprint of the raw response.

The module is stdlib-only and float-free, and -- per the SPEC S8.3 sandbox
boundary -- never imports ``windbreak.config``: its member is accepted
structurally via :class:`EnsembleMemberLike`.

The parsed vote's ``abstain`` flag is validated by the sanitize layer but not
yet acted on here: honoring an abstaining vote (excluding it from aggregation)
arrives with issue #193.
