"""SPEC S8.8 citation verification and its structured verdicts.

The forecast engine may only stand a citation behind a live-eligible forecast
once that citation has been *independently re-verified* against its own backing
source: the stored content hash must still match a fresh fetch, the quoted
excerpt (SPEC S8.5) must still be present in that content, any publication date
must be timezone-aware and not in the future, and the source type must be one
of the closed set SPEC S8.8 recognizes. :func:`verify_citation` performs those
checks in a fixed, first-failure order and always returns a
:class:`CitationVerdict` -- an unreachable URL (a denied egress or a transport
``OSError``) is an *unverified* result, never an uncaught exception, so a dead
source can never silently pass as verified.

Every fetch goes through the egress-guarded :meth:`ResearchTools.fetch`
capability (SPEC S8.3), never a raw transport, so citation verification can
never sidestep the sandbox's allowlist. This module never touches a float: it
sits on the probability/money path guarded by ``scripts/lint_no_floats.py``.
