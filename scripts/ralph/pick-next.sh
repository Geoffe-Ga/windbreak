#
# Ralph's picker. Prints the next open
# issue that is a real, unblocked, not-already-in-flight implementation issue
# AND is safe to start alongside whatever the fleet is already working — or
# nothing if the backlog is drained / nothing compatible remains.
#
# The picker is label-configurable. Tune via env vars:
#
#   RALPH_REQUIRE_LABELS  Space-separated labels an issue MUST have (ALL of
#                         them). Empty (default) = no required label; any open
#                         issue is a candidate.
#   RALPH_EXCLUDE_LABELS  Space-separated labels that DISQUALIFY an issue.
#                         Default excludes housekeeping / deferred / in-flight
#                         markers. Override to taste.
#   RALPH_SOLO_LABEL      Label marking an issue that must run ALONE (never in
#                         parallel with any other worker). Default: "solo".
#   RALPH_PARALLEL_LABEL  Label that overrides the same-epic guard so two issues
#                         under one epic may still run in parallel. Default:
#                         "parallelizable".
#   RALPH_RESPECT_EPICS   When "1" (default), a candidate that shares an
#                         epic-prefixed label with an active issue is skipped
#                         (likely ordered/overlapping) unless it carries the
#                         parallel label. Set "0" to disable the guard.
#   RALPH_DEFAULT_PRIORITY_RANK  Priority tier (0=P0 … 3=P3) assumed for an
#                         issue carrying no P-label. Default 1 (== P1). See the
#                         priority-tiering block below.
#
# Priority ordering: candidates are walked by [priority tier, number ascending],
# oldest-first within a tier. Tier 0 = P0 / priority-critical … tier 3 = P3 /
# priority-low (see the tiering block below — both label vocabularies are honored).
#
# Parallel awareness (see scripts/ralph/FLEET.md):
#   Issues already being worked — either an open PR (`Closes|Fixes|Resolves #N`)
#   or a live worktree under .ralph/worktrees/issue-<N> — are excluded. Among
#   what remains, the FIRST worker (empty active set) gets the lowest eligible
#   issue as before. Additional workers only get an issue that is *independent*
#   of every active issue: not `solo`, and (unless `parallelizable`) not sharing
#   an epic label with an active issue. A `solo` issue, once active, blocks any
#   further parallel pick. Correctness across imperfect independence guesses is
#   guaranteed at merge time by the orchestrator's serialized-merge + sync.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — issue number printed (or nothing if backlog empty / nothing compatible)
#   2 — gh CLI not authenticated / missing
#
# Requires bash >= 4 (associative arrays `declare -A`, `${var,,}` lowercasing);
# on macOS use /opt/homebrew/bin/bash (bash 5), not the system bash 3.2.

# Priority tiering. Candidates are ordered by priority tier first, then
# oldest-first WITHIN a tier: tier 0 (critical/breakage) preempts tier 1
# (bugs + feature issues) preempts tier 2 (quality) preempts tier 3 (hygiene).
#
# TWO label vocabularies map onto the same four tiers, so the picker honors both
# the repo's long-standing `priority-*` labels AND the maintenance pipeline's
# P0–P3 labels:
#   tier 0  ← `P0` or `priority-critical`
#   tier 1  ← `P1` or `priority-high`
#   tier 2  ← `P2` or `priority-medium`
#   tier 3  ← `P3` or `priority-low`
# An issue with none of these sorts at RALPH_DEFAULT_PRIORITY_RANK.
#
#   RALPH_DEFAULT_PRIORITY_RANK  Tier an unlabeled issue is treated as. Default
#                                1 (== P1), so legacy/unlabeled feature work
#                                keeps flowing at feature priority and only P2/P3
#                                scan hygiene sorts behind it. With no P-labels
#                                anywhere, every issue ranks equal and ordering
#                                collapses to the previous oldest-first behavior
#                                — this change is backward compatible.
#
# To enforce the pipeline's stricter "agent-ready required" gate (so ONLY fully
# specified scan/feature issues are picked), set RALPH_REQUIRE_LABELS=agent-ready.
# It is left empty by default to avoid starving an existing unlabeled backlog.
