# Authoritative "is this lane safe to merge?" check for the Ralph orchestrator
# (ralph-tick.md Step 1). Prints exactly one status token and exits 0 (it is a
# query — a non-zero exit means a usage/tooling error, never a PR verdict):
#
#   ready            LGTM (fresh) + CI green + up-to-date with main  → merge now
#   behind           LGTM (fresh) + CI green but mergeStateStatus BEHIND → sync first
#   pending          CI still running → wait for a later wake
#   ci-failed        CI has a failing/errored check → Step 2 (ci-debugging)
#   awaiting-review  no fresh LGTM verdict (missing, stale, or non-LGTM) → wait / Step 2
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the previous all-lanes Monitor grepped `gh pr checks` output
# for ': pending'. That output is TAB-delimited (name<TAB>pending<TAB>...), so the
# grep never matched and a still-running CI was read as settled — a false READY
# that could merge a PR with pending/failing checks. CI state here is keyed off
# the `gh pr checks` EXIT CODE, which is authoritative: 0 = all passed, 8 = some
# pending, anything else = failure. No text parsing of the checks table at all.
#
# Stale-verdict guard: a review verdict only counts when it was posted AFTER the
# PR's HEAD commit. An LGTM from before the latest push is stale (it reviewed
# older code) and must not gate a merge.
#
# Usage:  pr-ready.sh <PR_NUMBER> [--repo <owner/repo>]

# `gh pr checks` exit code that means "checks still pending" (gh's documented
# contract: 0 = pass, 8 = pending, other = failure).

# The canonical verdict line `claude-code-review.yml` posts is
# `## Verdict: <LGTM|CHANGES_REQUESTED|COMMENTS>` (also tolerated: `**Verdict:**`
# and a bare `Verdict:`), sitting at the END of a longer `## Summary …` body — so
# the match must be case-insensitive AND multiline (`m`, so `^` anchors to the
# verdict line — which sits at the END of a multi-line `## Summary …` body, not
# at string start), prefix-tolerant, and keyed to the verdict LINE (a stray
# "LGTM" in prose must not count). Reviewers are also seen posting `## Verdict`
# as a bare heading with an emoji-prefixed token on the NEXT line (e.g.
# `## Verdict\n✅ LGTM`), so the LGTM separator tolerates any non-alphanumeric
# decoration (emoji/whitespace/newline) between `verdict` and `lgtm`. That stays
# safe: a stray "LGTM" in prose never matches (it is keyed to the verdict line),
# and a non-LGTM token like COMMENTS/CHANGES_REQUESTED puts a letter right after
# the emoji, breaking the non-alphanumeric run before any later "LGTM". Only the
# LGTM matcher widens; `VERDICT_RE` (comment selection) keeps its strict
# `[:*\s]` class unchanged. Backslashes are doubled because this text is spliced
# into a jq string literal, where `\s` is an invalid escape and must reach the
# regex engine as `\\s` (the negated class `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` has no backslash, so
# it is spelled literally — the explicit form self-documents and sidesteps the
# Oniguruma subtlety of case-folding a negated class). The per-branch fragments
# are SINGLE-quoted (not folded into the surrounding double quotes) so their
# `\\s` survives verbatim: inside double quotes bash would collapse `\\s` → `\s`,
# which jq then rejects as an invalid escape — the class must stay `[:*\\s]`.
