# Authoritative "is this lane safe to merge?" check for the Ralph orchestrator
# (ralph-tick.md Step 1). Prints exactly one status token and exits 0 (it is a
# query — a non-zero exit means a usage/tooling error, never a PR verdict):
#
#   ready            LGTM (fresh) + CI green + up-to-date with main  → merge now
#   behind           LGTM (fresh) + CI green but mergeStateStatus BEHIND → sync first
#   pending          CI still running → wait for a later wake
#   ci-failed        CI has a failing/errored check → Step 2 (ci-debugging)
#   awaiting-review  no fresh LGTM verdict (missing, stale, or non-LGTM) → wait / Step 2
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the previous all-lanes Monitor grepped `gh pr checks` output
# for ': pending'. That output is TAB-delimited (name<TAB>pending<TAB>...), so the
# grep never matched and a still-running CI was read as settled — a false READY
# that could merge a PR with pending/failing checks. CI state here is keyed off
# the `gh pr checks` EXIT CODE, which is authoritative: 0 = all passed, 8 = some
# pending, anything else = failure. No text parsing of the checks table at all.
#
# Stale-verdict guard: a review verdict only counts when it was posted AFTER the
# PR's HEAD commit. An LGTM from before the latest push is stale (it reviewed
# older code) and must not gate a merge.
#
# Usage:  pr-ready.sh <PR_NUMBER> [--repo <owner/repo>]
set -euo pipefail

# `gh pr checks` exit code that means "checks still pending" (gh's documented
# contract: 0 = pass, 8 = pending, other = failure).
