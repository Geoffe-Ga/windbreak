# scripts/provision-venv.sh - Provision/refresh the SHARED repo-local .venv
# Usage: ./scripts/provision-venv.sh [--print-venv | --check | --help]
#
# Provisions a SINGLE shared virtual environment at the MAIN repo root and
# reuses it from every fleet worktree, so check-all.sh runs against the pinned
# quality toolchain (constraints-quality.txt) regardless of the operator's
# global Python -- ending fleet-wide pip-audit drift noise (issue #133).
#
# The shared venv lives at "<main-worktree-root>/.venv". A call from inside a
# linked worktree (.ralph/worktrees/issue-N/) still resolves to the SAME main
# root .venv, so the toolchain is installed once and shared by all lanes.
#
# CONCURRENCY: because the .venv is shared, two fleet lanes that independently
# detect toolchain drift could otherwise run `python3 -m venv` / `pip install`
# into the SAME site-packages at once and corrupt it (interleaved writes), or
# thrash it back and forth when their branches pin different constraints. So the
# create+install section is serialized with an advisory lock:
#   - Mechanism: a mkdir-based lock directory ("<venv>.lock"). mkdir is atomic
#     on every POSIX filesystem, and unlike flock(1) it needs no extra binary --
#     macOS ships no flock(1) by default, while the Linux CI runner does, so a
#     mkdir lock is the portable common denominator that works on both.
#   - Liveness: the lock records its holder's PID; a lock whose holder PID is no
#     longer alive is treated as stale and reclaimed (atomically, so two lanes
#     can't both reclaim it), so a lane that crashes mid-provision -- or is
#     SIGINT/SIGTERM-killed before its EXIT trap can release the lock -- can't
#     wedge the fleet forever. Waiters honor PROVISION_LOCK_TIMEOUT (seconds,
#     default 300) and never steal a lock held by a live process.
#   - Convergence (anti-thrash): after acquiring the lock, provision() RE-CHECKS
#     drift and skips reinstalling when a sibling lane already provisioned to
#     matching constraints. The shared venv therefore converges to the pins of
#     whichever lane last ran, rather than being reinstalled once per lane.

Usage: $(basename "$0") [OPTIONS]

Provision/refresh the SINGLE shared repo-local .venv at the main repo root and
reuse it from every fleet worktree so quality checks run against the pinned
toolchain (constraints-quality.txt).

OPTIONS:
    --print-venv   Print the resolved shared .venv absolute path and exit.
    --check        Drift check only (never creates/installs): exit 0 when the
                   installed toolchain matches constraints-quality.txt, nonzero
                   (with a provision-venv.sh hint) when drifted or missing.
    --help         Display this help message.
    (no option)    Provision: create the shared .venv if absent, then install
                   the pinned toolchain only when fresh or drifted (idempotent).

EXIT CODES:
    0           Success (in sync, provisioned, or informational)
    1           Drift detected / provisioning failed
    2           Error running the script (e.g. unknown option)

EXAMPLES:
    $(basename "$0")                # Provision or refresh the shared .venv
    $(basename "$0") --print-venv   # Print the shared .venv path
    $(basename "$0") --check        # Fail loudly on toolchain drift
