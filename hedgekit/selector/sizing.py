"""Dispersion-scaled fractional-Kelly sizing and cap clipping (SPEC S9.5/S9.6).

Three separately testable pure stages the selector chains after every SPEC S9.3
entry condition passes, plus a small result type:

    * :func:`dispersion_scale` -- the linear ``g()`` ramp of SPEC S9.6 that
      discounts the Kelly stake as the ensemble's vote dispersion rises toward a
      configured ceiling, in ppm.
    * :func:`kelly_size` -- the binary-contract fractional-Kelly stake (SPEC
      S9.5): full-Kelly ``f* = edge / (1 - P)`` scaled by the configured Kelly
      fraction and the dispersion scale, in contract-centis. The numerator is the
      *research-cost-adjusted net* edge, so "never negative-EV-after-fees" is
      structural -- a below-floor net edge sizes to exactly zero.
    * :func:`clip_to_caps` -- clips a raw stake down through the five SPEC S9.6
      notional caps (in a pinned order), the participation cap, and the exchange
      minimum-order-size quantization, naming which cap bound.

Every size-affecting division is integer, routed through
:func:`hedgekit.numeric.divide` with an explicit
:data:`~hedgekit.numeric.RoundingDirection.UNDERSTATE_EQUITY` (floor): a stake
or a cap headroom is never *over*-stated, so the selector always errs toward the
smaller, safer size. There is no ``float``, no bare ``/`` or ``//`` anywhere;
this module is on ``scripts/lint_no_floats.py``'s denylist.

Two seams are deliberately fenced here, matching :mod:`hedgekit.selector.entry`'s
``_SCREENER_SEAM_DETAIL`` style:

    * **Mode ceiling and live-micro cap.** SPEC S10.2's mode-gated ceilings (the
      operating-mode ceiling and the LIVE_MICRO absolute exposure cap) are
      *not* mirrored here: :class:`~hedgekit.selector.types.SelectorInputs`
      carries no operating-mode field, so the selector cannot know the active
      mode. The Kernel enforces both caps authoritatively (SPEC S10.2); the
      selector's job is only to size conservatively beneath them.
    * **Exchange minimum-order size.** The whole-contract quantization here uses
      a fixed :data:`_EXCHANGE_MIN_ORDER_CENTIS` constant (one whole contract).
      A future seam will read the venue's real per-market minimum-order size
      from the normalized market metadata (SPEC S6.2); until that metadata is
      threaded into ``SelectorInputs``, one whole contract is the conservative
      floor.
