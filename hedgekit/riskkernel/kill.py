"""The Risk Kernel kill switch and its four trigger sources (SPEC S10.12, issue #35).

This module gives the Risk Kernel a single kill executor, :class:`KillSwitch`,
reachable from four independent triggers -- a CLI ``KILL`` file, an in-process
``KILL`` state-dir file, a dashboard challenge/confirm handshake, and
consecutive reconciliation-mismatch auto-detection -- plus the
typed-confirmation re-arm that is the *only* way back out of ``KILLED``.

Every trigger funnels into :meth:`KillSwitch.kill`, which composes the LOCKED
:mod:`hedgekit.riskkernel.modes` primitives (it never widens the mode ladder):
it drives the machine to ``KILLED`` *first* (the fail-safe direction), then
records the closed kill-effect surface -- one :class:`KillEngaged`, one
:class:`CancelAllDirective`, and one ``ReservationReleased`` per active
reservation -- dispatches one ``HALT_KILL`` alert, and drops a ``KILL`` file.
The switch **holds positions by design**: it only cancels resting orders and
releases capital reservations, and no string it ever ledgers names a
sell/close/submit/dump action.

The trigger adapters (:class:`KillFileWatcher`,
:class:`ReconciliationMismatchMonitor`, :class:`DashboardKillStub`) are all
poll- or event-driven with no unbounded waits: the fleet drives them one beat
at a time. :class:`KillIntegration` bundles the switch and its adapters into
the single value the Risk Kernel process consumes.

**Wiring status (issue #35, follow-up tracked in #144):** these adapters are
fully built and tested here, but they are *not yet composed into the live
``hedgekit run`` process* -- ``hedgekit/main.py`` never constructs a
:class:`~hedgekit.riskkernel.process.RiskKernel` or a :class:`KillIntegration`,
and ``process.main()`` does not yet pass ``kill_integration=``. Until that
wiring lands, ``hedgekit kill`` writes a ``KILL`` file that no running kernel
polls, so it does *not* halt a live deployment; the ``KILL`` file's presence is
the durable signal a wired watcher *will* act on once composed.

Everything on this path is float-free (SPEC S6.1): epoch seconds and kill
sequence numbers are ``int`` only.
