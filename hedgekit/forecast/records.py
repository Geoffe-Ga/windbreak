"""SPEC S6.3 forecast record schema and its JSON-safe projection.

Every model here is a frozen, slotted dataclass describing one facet of a
produced forecast: the ensemble :class:`ModelVote`s, their supporting
:class:`Citation`s, the :class:`BaselineQuoteSnapshot` the forecast was struck
against, and the immutable :class:`ForecastRecord` that ties them together.
Probability-bearing quantities are carried as bare parts-per-million integers
(``probability_ppm`` etc.) -- never floats -- so this package sits on the
probability/money path guarded by ``scripts/lint_no_floats.py``.

:class:`ForecastRecord` validates its range, integrality, non-emptiness, and
closed-set invariants in ``__post_init__`` so a malformed record fails loudly
at construction. :func:`forecast_record_to_payload` renders a record into a
JSON-safe mapping (datetimes as ISO-8601 ``Z`` strings, tuples of dataclasses
as lists of dicts, no float leaf anywhere) for ledger/event emission.
