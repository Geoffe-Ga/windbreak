"""The :class:`KalshiConnector` adapter over Kalshi's public read-only surface.

:class:`KalshiConnector` implements the SPEC S7.2
:class:`~hedgekit.connector.interface.MarketConnector` protocol against a
:class:`~hedgekit.connector.kalshi.client.KalshiClient`. It exposes only the
public, read-only market-data methods this issue delivers -- ``list_markets``,
``get_market``, ``get_order_book``, ``get_exchange_status``, and
``get_exchange_time`` -- normalizing each raw payload through
:mod:`hedgekit.connector.kalshi.normalize`. ``list_markets`` applies the binary
allowlist and ledgers one ``PRODUCT_REFUSED`` event per refused product through
an injected :class:`~hedgekit.connector.snapshot.EventLedgerWriter`, isolating a
broken writer so one bad record never aborts a run.

The fee-model and balance-semantics methods are implemented here (issue #18):
:meth:`KalshiConnector.get_fee_model` resolves a series' fee schedule and
:meth:`KalshiConnector.get_balance_semantics` returns the recorded
:data:`KALSHI_BALANCE_SEMANTICS` record. The remaining trading and account
methods (order path is milestone M4; balances, positions, open orders, fills
are issue #3) still raise :class:`NotImplementedError` until those issues wire
them. This module sits on the money path guarded by
``scripts/lint_no_floats.py``: no ``/`` or ``float`` appears anywhere.
