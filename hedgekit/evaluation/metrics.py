"""Forecast-track statistical metrics for the evaluation harness (#51).

SPEC-EPIC_07 S13.5's forecast-quality machinery, computed with *zero floats*:
every statistic is exact integer arithmetic over the parts-per-million (ppm)
integers carried on :class:`~hedgekit.evaluation.registry.EvaluationInputs`, and
every reported value is a ppm-scaled ``int`` produced through the sanctioned
:func:`hedgekit.numeric.rounding.divide` with an explicit conservative rounding
direction. There is no ``float()``, no ``math.log``, and no bare true-division on
the value path anywhere in this module.

The scalar metrics (:func:`mean_brier`, :func:`mean_log_score`,
:func:`brier_skill`, :func:`expected_calibration_error`,
:func:`calibration_slope`, :func:`calibration_intercept`, :func:`sharpness`)
each take ``(inputs, *, window)`` and return a single ``int``. The rich reports
(:func:`reliability_diagram`, :func:`price_bucket_report`,
:func:`edge_bucket_report`) return tuples of frozen dataclasses.

Only forecasts whose ``market_ticker`` resolves enter any metric (S13.6):
forecasts on unresolved or absent tickers are excluded, and an empty resolved
set raises :class:`ValueError` rather than silently scoring zero observations.

This module imports :class:`~hedgekit.evaluation.registry.EvaluationInputs` and
its collaborators only under :data:`typing.TYPE_CHECKING`, keeping the
registry->metrics dependency a one-way *annotation-only* edge with no runtime
import cycle; :class:`~hedgekit.evaluation.resolution.ResolutionOutcome` is the
one runtime import, from the dependency-free resolution leaf.
