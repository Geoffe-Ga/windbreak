"""Metric registry and typed inputs for the evaluation harness (#49, #51, #53).

This module owns SPEC-EPIC_07's three-track evaluation vocabulary -- the
:class:`Track` taxonomy, the typed :class:`FixtureForecast` /
:class:`EvaluationInputs` carriers, the :class:`MetricSpec` shape, and the
:func:`registered_metrics` catalogue -- and wires each spec's ``compute`` to its
real arithmetic. :class:`ObservationWindow` is re-exported from its canonical
home in :mod:`hedgekit.evaluation.windows` (#53), so
``registry.ObservationWindow is windows.ObservationWindow`` and every existing
import site keeps working unchanged.

As of issue #51 the seven forecast-track metrics (``brier``,
``brier_skill_vs_executable_price``, ``log_score``,
``expected_calibration_error``, ``calibration_slope``,
``calibration_intercept``, ``sharpness``) delegate to
:mod:`hedgekit.evaluation.metrics`; issue #53 makes
``traded_vs_skipped_brier_delta`` a real computation too, delegating to
:mod:`hedgekit.evaluation.cohorts`. These are one-way runtime edges with no
cycle: ``metrics`` and ``cohorts`` reference this module's types only under
``TYPE_CHECKING``.

One metric remains a deliberate stub whose ``compute`` returns the
:data:`NOT_IMPLEMENTED` sentinel (a distinct :class:`NotImplementedSentinel`
value, never ``None`` and never a stray ``int``) so the renderer prints the
literal ``NOT_IMPLEMENTED`` rather than omitting the row: the execution-track
``fill_vs_model_slippage``.

A fully-implemented metric can still be *undefined* for a given input rather
than unimplemented: ``traded_vs_skipped_brier_delta`` is undefined whenever the
window holds zero ``TRADED`` or zero ``SKIPPED`` forecasts (an ordinary
early-deployment state), so its adapter catches
:class:`~hedgekit.evaluation.cohorts.EmptyCohortError` and returns the distinct
:data:`~hedgekit.evaluation.cohorts.UNDEFINED` sentinel -- keeping "not yet
built" (``NOT_IMPLEMENTED``) and "built but undefined here" (``UNDEFINED``)
nominally separate, and never letting the empty-cohort case crash the report.
