# Ralph subagent taxonomy

The cast of subagents the **Ralph loop** dispatches to build one backlog issue per
tick. The conductor is the main Ralph session
(`.claude/commands/ralph-tick.md` → `scripts/ralph/PROMPT.md`); it spawns every
agent below via the `Agent` tool. The ralph-chief-architect is the strategic **brain**
(plans + a dispatch list); the specialists are the **hands**.

> Every agent links there; change a rule once, there.

## The graph (honest — every node exists in this repo)

In the **parallel fleet** (`scripts/ralph/FLEET.md`), `ralph-tick` is the fleet
**orchestrator**: it manages up to `max_workers` (default 4) git worktrees and
dispatches one **`ralph-worker`** per issue, each of which is the per-issue
conductor *inside its own worktree* (it spawns the graph below). In the classic
sequential loop the orchestrator drives a single worker. Either way the spawn
graph under a conductor is identical:

```
ralph-tick (fleet ORCHESTRATOR — worker pool: reconcile · serialized-merge · lazy-sync · refill)
  └─ ralph-worker × up to 4 . L1  opus    per-issue CONDUCTOR in an isolated worktree
       ├─ ralph-chief-architect ..... L0  fable   plan + ordered dispatch list (no code)
       ├─ ralph-test-specialist ..... L2  opus    Gate 1 RED: failing tests          ─┐
       ├─ implementation-spec.  L2  opus    Gate 1 GREEN + Refactor             │ run per
       ├─ ralph-security-specialist . L2  opus    harden auth/JWT/CORS/input/DB       │ the
       ├─ performance-spec. ... L2  opus    profile/optimize hot paths          │ architect's
       ├─ documentation-spec. . L2  opus    docstrings/READMEs/ADRs             │ dispatch
       ├─ dependency-review ... L2  haiku   deps/pins/licenses (read-only)      │ list
       └─ code-review-orch. ... L1  sonnet  Gate 2.5 pre-push self-review      ─┘
```

**The tree above is the spawn graph: each conductor (`ralph-worker`, or
`ralph-tick` itself in the sequential loop) spawns every node under it directly.**
It is *not* a delegation hierarchy — the indentation does not mean ralph-chief-architect
spawns the others. ralph-chief-architect only *plans*; the conductor executes its
ordered dispatch list by spawning each specialist itself. The orchestrator
(`ralph-tick`) spawns `ralph-worker`s and nothing else; each worker spawns the
taxonomy inside its own worktree.

The frontmatter `delegates_to` / `receives_from` fields model **logical dataflow**
(who informs whom — e.g. the architect's risk flags reach the reviewers), **not**
the spawn mechanism, which is always the conductor. Only the two orchestrators
(ralph-chief-architect, ralph-code-review-orchestrator) hold the `Task` tool; the six
specialists are leaf workers that do their own work and do not sub-delegate.

> **Frontmatter caveat.** The Claude Code runtime only reads `name`,
> `description`, `tools`, and `model`. The extra fields here — `level`, `phase`,
> `delegates_to`, `receives_from` — are **descriptive documentation only**; they
> do not drive dispatch, ordering, or permissions. The conductor's dispatch
> logic is authoritative. Nested spawning (an orchestrator using `Task`) is
> best-effort: agents that rely on it must degrade to Read/Grep/Glob when it is
> unavailable, never stall.

> **Shared constraints are not auto-injected.** A subagent's context is only its
> own `.md` file; markdown links are inert. Every agent's Step 0 therefore
> **`Read`s** [`shared/house-rules.md`](shared/house-rules.md)
> at the start of its run so the gates, thresholds, and anti-bypass block
> actually bind — the link alone does not carry them into context.

## Model tiers (role-based policy)

Model assignment follows **role, not history** (owner directive, 2026-07-24):

| Role | Model | Agents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planning / architecture | **fable** | `ralph-chief-architect` |
| Implementation (writes code) | **opus** | `ralph-worker`, `ralph-implementation-specialist`, `ralph-test-specialist`, `ralph-performance-specialist`, `ralph-documentation-specialist` |
| Security hardening | **opus** | `ralph-security-specialist` |
| Review (review-only) | **sonnet** | `ralph-code-review-orchestrator` |
| Quick mechanical checks | **haiku** | `ralph-dependency-review-specialist` |

The aliases are what the frontmatter carries, and they resolve to the current
frontier of each line: `fable` → Claude Fable 5, `opus` → Claude Opus 5.

**Fable** for exactly one seat: `ralph-chief-architect`. Planning is the
highest-leverage decision in a tick — one wrong design compounds across every
specialist that executes it — so the architect gets the strongest
judgment-driven model. Fable also prefers **less-prescriptive prompts** (state the
goal and constraints, not step-by-step scaffolding), which is how that agent's
definition is written.

**Opus** for every agent that writes code — `ralph-worker` (it applies fixes
directly, not just conducts), `ralph-implementation-specialist`,
`ralph-test-specialist`, `ralph-performance-specialist`,
`ralph-documentation-specialist` — and for `ralph-security-specialist`. Security
would be the one seat to keep off Fable regardless: Fable's safety classifiers
target **cyber/bio** content, so legitimate hardening work can trip a
false-positive refusal. Dual-role specialists — the Gate-1 code writers that also
serve as Gate-2.5 dimension reviewers — keep a single definition and run their
assigned model in both roles; there are no reviewer-variant files.

### Fable fallback (out of credits)

Fable capacity is metered separately from Opus, and Claude Code has no per-agent
fallback *chain* — a subagent's model resolves from `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`,
then the per-invocation `model` parameter, then this frontmatter. So when Fable
credits run out and an architect dispatch fails to launch, the tick **degrades to
Opus rather than stalling**, by changing one of those inputs:

1. **In-session (preferred).** The conductor re-dispatches immediately with a
   per-invocation override — `Agent(subagent_type: ralph-chief-architect,
   model: "opus")`. It outranks the frontmatter, so no file changes.
2. **For the rest of the run.** Flip the pin once so later ticks skip the failing
   Fable attempt: `./scripts/ralph/architect-model.sh opus`
   (`... fable` restores it; no argument prints the current pin).

Falling back is a **capacity** decision, never a weakened gate — an Opus architect
plans to the same standard, and every rule in
[`shared/house-rules.md`](house-rules.md) applies unchanged.

**Sonnet** for the review-only synthesis role: `ralph-code-review-orchestrator`.

**Haiku** for the purely mechanical, read-only checklist walk:
`ralph-dependency-review-specialist` (pins/lockfile/license checks need no deep
reasoning — spend the cheaper tier).

## Gate → agent invocation matrix

| Stage | Conductor action | Agent(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plan | architect the issue → plan + dispatch list | **ralph-chief-architect** |
| Gate 1 RED | write failing tests | **ralph-test-specialist** |
| Gate 1 GREEN | implement + refactor to green | **ralph-implementation-specialist** |
| Cross-cutting (only if flagged) | harden / optimize / document / vet deps | **security / performance / documentation / dependency** specialists |
| Gate 2 | run `./scripts/<side>/check-all.sh` | — (conductor, Bash) |
| Gate 2.5 | pre-push self-review of the diff | **ralph-code-review-orchestrator** (reviews the flagged dimensions itself; may fan out to specialists in review mode where nested spawning is available) |
| Push / PR | commit, push, open PR | — (conductor) |
| Gate 3 fail (CI) | `ci-debugging` → fix | **test / implementation** specialist |
| Gate 4 fail (review) | `address-feedback` → fix | the specialist owning the comment's dimension |

## Dispatch sequence (one tick, one issue)

1. **ralph-chief-architect** reads the issue + `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, returns an
   Architecture Plan with an ordered dispatch list and risk flags
   (security / performance / deps / docs).
2. The conductor executes the list **sequentially** (write-agents share one
   working tree — no parallel edits): ralph-test-specialist → ralph-implementation-specialist
   → any flagged cross-cutting specialists.
3. Conductor runs **Gate 2** (`check-all.sh`); failures drop to Gate 1 via the
   relevant specialist.
4. **ralph-code-review-orchestrator** runs **Gate 2.5** over the diff and returns a
   consolidated, severity-ranked report; the conductor fixes blockers (drop to
   Gate 1) until `CLEAN`.
5. Conductor commits, pushes, opens the PR; Gates 3–4 proceed per
   `ralph-tick.md`.

## Design rules

- **Omit, don't pad.** The architect names only the specialists a given issue
  needs; invoking an unneeded specialist is waste, not thoroughness.
- **Plans flow down, findings flow up.** ralph-chief-architect → specialists;
  ralph-code-review-orchestrator ← specialists.
- **No gate is ever weakened to pass.** Every drop-back is a root-cause,
  failing-test-first fix (see `shared/house-rules.md`).
