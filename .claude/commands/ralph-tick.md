description: One tick of the local Ralph loop. Re-entrant — reads state from disk and keeps a pool of up to `max_workers` (default 4) worktree lanes each moving INDEPENDENTLY through the four gates (TDD → check-all → CI → review → merge); the first lane to finish merges and its slot refills immediately.

## The core principle (this is what "responsibly" means)

**Optimistic parallelism, pessimistic merge — but never a barrier.**

- **Optimistic pick.** `pick-next.sh` hands out issues that look independent, up
  to the worker cap. Each is built in an isolated worktree through Gates 1–2.5.
- **Independent lanes.** Lanes do not wait for each other. A fast lane at Gate 4
  does not wait for a slow lane still at Gate 1. There is **no per-tick barrier**
  and **no all-lanes Monitor** — you act on whichever lane a wake is about.
- **Pessimistic, serialized merge.** Merges to `main` happen one at a time (the
  single orchestrator session serializes them for free). A lane merges only when
  it is `LGTM` + CI-green + **up-to-date with `main`**. If `main` moved since a
  lane went green, that lane **syncs** first (`fleet.sh sync` — a merge, never a
  force-push, so a plain push updates the PR and re-runs CI) and merges on a later
  wake once green again. A sync conflict drops that lane to Gate 1.
- **Immediate refill.** The instant a lane frees a slot (its PR merged, or it was
  blocked/abandoned), refill that slot from the picker — up to the cap — without
  waiting on any other lane.

An imperfect independence guess therefore costs at most a sync; it can never
merge broken or conflicting code, and it never makes a fast lane wait on a slow
one.

## The four gates (and the drop-back rule)
| Gate | Check | On pass | On fail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **TDD** (Red→Green→Refactor, `stay-green`) | → Gate 2 | — |
| 2 | **`./scripts/<side>/check-all.sh`** (backend and/or frontend) | → push → Gate 3 | **drop to Gate 1** |
| 3 | **CI** all green | → Gate 4 | **drop to Gate 1** (via `ci-debugging`) |
| 4 | **Claude review `Verdict:`** | `LGTM` + green + up-to-date → **merge + mark issue done + refill** | **drop to Gate 1** (via `address-feedback`) |

"Drop to Gate 1" means: fix the root cause with a failing-test-first cycle, re-clear Gate 2 locally, push, and climb again. Never weaken a gate to pass it.

## The subagent taxonomy (workers are your conductors)

You do not write code in the main loop. For each lane you dispatch a
**`ralph-worker`** (`Agent`, `subagent_type: ralph-worker`) that works **inside
that issue's worktree** and is itself the per-issue conductor: it spawns the
`ralph-chief-architect` for the plan and runs the specialists in `.claude/agents/` (map
+ tiers in `.claude/agents/README.md`; shared rules in
`.claude/agents/shared/house-rules.md`). A build worker carries the
issue through Gates 1–2.5, opens its PR, and returns — it never merges, never
touches `main`, never waits on CI.

**Workers are BACKGROUND tasks — this is what makes the lanes independent.**
Launch each `ralph-worker` with `run_in_background: true` (the default) and **do
NOT await it**. You launch, then end your turn; each worker's completion is its
own wake. **Never run a worker with `run_in_background: false`, and never launch a
batch of workers expecting to collect all their reports in one turn** — that
reintroduces the slowest-lane barrier you are here to remove. Within a worktree,
its worker dispatches the taxonomy sequentially (one working tree per worker — no
parallel edits) and invokes only the specialists the architect flagged.

---

## On each wake, do these in order, then end the turn

### Step 0 — Pause check, reconcile, snapshot the pool
```bash
if [ -f scripts/ralph/.paused ]; then echo "paused"; fi
cat scripts/ralph/state.json                 # groom + de-slop counters, max_workers, parallel_enabled
scripts/ralph/fleet.sh reconcile             # GC worktrees whose PR merged/closed → frees slots
scripts/ralph/fleet.sh list                  # occupied lanes: <issue> <branch> <path>
scripts/ralph/fleet.sh free                  # open slots right now
```
If `scripts/ralph/.paused` exists: `ScheduleWakeup` (~1800s, reason "ralph paused") and end the turn. Do not pick or work.

Snapshot **every in-flight Ralph PR** with its mergeability, CI, and verdict:
```bash
gh pr list --state open --author "@me" \
  --json number,headRefName,body,mergeable,mergeStateStatus \
  --jq '.[] | select(.body | test("(?i)(closes|fixes|resolves)\\s+#[0-9]+"))'
```
Each in-flight PR is a lane in Gate 3/4; each occupied worktree without a PR yet
is a lane still building (its worker is running in the background). Together they
are the pool.

**Mode A — all done.** If the pool is empty (no worktrees, no in-flight PRs) AND
`pick-next.sh` prints nothing: announce "Backlog drained. Ralph is done." and
call `/loop` to **stop**.

### Step 0.5 — Main-health check (P0, owner directive 2026-07-05)

A red `main` outranks every lane. On every wake:
```bash
gh run list --branch main --workflow ci.yml --limit 1 --json conclusion --jq '.[0].conclusion'
gh issue list --label ci-red --state open --json number --jq '.[].number'
```
If the latest completed CI run on `main` failed, or an open `ci-red` issue
exists (filed by `main-red-alarm.yml`): **dispatch a ci-debugging worker on it
immediately** — do not wait for the picker, do not refill other slots first.
The worker reproduces from the failing run, fixes the root cause
failing-test-first, and opens a PR; never weaken a gate to go green. Close the
`ci-red` issue only when CI on `main` is green again.

### Step 1 — Merge every ready lane (serialized, up-to-date only)

Classify each in-flight PR with the authoritative readiness helper — never
eyeball the CI rollup or grep `gh pr checks` (its output is TAB-delimited, so a
`': pending'` grep silently misses a still-running check and a false READY can
merge a pending/failing PR). The helper keys CI off the `gh pr checks` **exit
code** (`0`=green, `8`=pending, else=failed) and only honours an LGTM verdict
posted **after** the PR's HEAD commit (stale-verdict guard):
```bash
STATUS=$(scripts/ralph/pr-ready.sh "$PR_NUM")   # ready | behind | pending | ci-failed | awaiting-review
```
Read the PR's comments once for context (which issue it closes, verdict text):
```bash
gh pr view "$PR_NUM" --comments --json state,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,comments
```
Then act on `$STATUS`:

- **`ready`** (`Verdict: LGTM` fresh + CI green + `mergeStateStatus` `CLEAN`,
  i.e. up-to-date with `main`). **Merge it now** — do not wait for any other
  lane:
  ```bash
  gh pr merge "$PR_NUM" --squash --delete-branch
  ISSUE_N=<issue this PR closed>
  gh issue close "$ISSUE_N" --reason completed 2>/dev/null || true
  git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
  scripts/ralph/fleet.sh release "$ISSUE_N"        # frees the slot
  python3 -c "import json;p='scripts/ralph/state.json';s=json.load(open(p));s['completed_since_groom']+=1;s['completed_since_deslop']=s.get('completed_since_deslop',0)+1;s['total_completed']+=1;s['last_completed_issue']=$ISSUE_N;open(p,'w').write(json.dumps(s,indent=2)+'\n')"
  ```
  (Idempotent if `iteration-trigger.yml` or a prior wake already merged it — the
  PR shows MERGED; do the same close + `release` + state bump.)
- **`behind`** (`LGTM` + green but `mergeStateStatus` is `BEHIND` — a sibling
  merged after this lane went green). **Do not merge stale.** Sync it and let CI
  re-run:
  ```bash
  scripts/ralph/fleet.sh sync "$ISSUE_N" || echo "SYNC-CONFLICT $ISSUE_N"
  ```
  A clean sync → dispatch its `ralph-worker` to re-clear Gate 2 locally and push;
  it re-merges on a later wake once green. `SYNC-CONFLICT` → that lane drops to
  Gate 1 (worker resolves the conflict as a root-cause change, re-greens, pushes).
- **`awaiting-review` with a fresh non-LGTM verdict — triage it, don't just
  wait** (owner directive 2026-07-05): read the verdict comment posted after
  HEAD. **`CHANGES_REQUESTED` always blocks** → Step 2 (`address-feedback`).
  **`COMMENTS` with zero blocking findings** (no 🔴/BLOCKING items, no
  insufficient-testing flag) may merge exactly like an LGTM once CI is green
  and the PR is up-to-date — file the non-blocking nits as backlog issues (or
  leave them to the groom gate) so the pipeline keeps flowing. `COMMENTS`
  **with** any blocking finding → Step 2 (`address-feedback`). Merging is
  NEVER allowed with failing or pending CI — all-green + fresh verdict is the
  floor, no exceptions.
- **`pending`** / **`awaiting-review`** (no fresh verdict yet) — CI is still
  running or the reviewer hasn't posted for this HEAD. Leave the lane; its
  Step 5 subscription wakes you when CI or the verdict changes. **Exception — missing review usually means a merge
  conflict:** if the verdict never arrives and the `claude-review` check is
  absent from the rollup entirely, check
  `gh pr view N --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` FIRST. A `CONFLICTING`/`DIRTY`
  PR has no merge ref, so GitHub creates **no `pull_request`-event runs at all**
  (any green checks are `push`-event runs on the branch) — no amount of
  re-kicking (`gh run rerun`, empty commits) will produce a review. Resolve the
  conflict (`fleet.sh sync` → conflict-fix worker → push); the post-resolution
  push triggers the PR's real CI + review.
- **`ci-failed`** — a check failed. Advance it via Step 2 (`ci-debugging`).

You may merge more than one lane in a wake, but **re-check `mergeStateStatus`
before each merge** — merging one lane can push the others `BEHIND`. Serialized,
always up-to-date: correctness holds; a ready lane is never held back by a slow
sibling.

If any merge happened, commit the `state.json` bump **once** — a single commit
covering every merge this wake (state-only changes may go directly on `main`).

### Step 2 — Advance failing lanes (per PR, independent)

For each in-flight PR **not** merged, dispatch a **background** `ralph-worker`
into that PR's worktree only if it needs a fix (re-attach a worktree with
`scripts/ralph/fleet.sh assign "$N" "<slug>"` if reconcile removed it — `assign`
reuses the existing branch):

- **Gate 4 failed** (`CHANGES_REQUESTED`/`COMMENTS`): worker runs the
  **`address-feedback`** flow in the worktree — triage, TDD fix loop dispatching
  the specialist that owns each comment, re-clear Gate 2 + Gate 2.5, push, reply,
  resolve threads.
- **Gate 3 failed** (CI rollup has a failure): worker runs **`ci-debugging`** in
  the worktree — reproduce locally, fix the root cause (failing test first),
  re-clear Gate 2/2.5, push.
- **In progress** (CI running, or verdict not yet posted): do nothing — this
  lane's PR subscription (Step 5) wakes you when it changes.
- **`dependencies` PRs** (from `dependabot-to-ralph-issue.yml`): the in-flight PR
  is **Dependabot's own branch** (linked via `Closes`). Push Gate-1/Gate-3 fixes
  **to that branch**, never a fresh branch or second PR. A breaking major is a
  normal Gate-1 TDD adaptation — never pin back, suppress, or weaken a gate.
  Dependabot stops rebasing once the PR carries a non-Dependabot commit. Any
  dependency deliberately pinned pending a larger upgrade epic should note that
  epic's issue number in `.github/dependabot.yml`'s `ignore` comment.

These fix-workers are background too — launch, don't await.

### Step 3 — Groom gate (every Nth completion)

When `completed_since_groom >= groom_interval`:
1. Invoke **`/backlog-grooming`** as a Skill (label/close ops are safe while lanes build).
2. Reset the counter and stamp:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json,datetime;p='scripts/ralph/state.json';s=json.load(open(p));s['completed_since_groom']=0;s['last_groom_at']=datetime.datetime.now().isoformat();open(p,'w').write(json.dumps(s,indent=2)+'\n')"
   ```
3. Commit the state change (state-only changes may go directly on `main`).

### Step 3.5 — De-slop gate (every `deslop_interval` completions)

When `completed_since_deslop >= deslop_interval` (default 30; check after
Step 1's bump):
1. Dispatch the targeted de-slop scan matrix on GitHub's runners — never run
   the audit inside the loop (it would eat a lane's context for hours):
   ```bash
   gh workflow run deslop.yml        # all areas from .github/deslop-areas.json
   ```
2. Reset the counter and stamp:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json,datetime;p='scripts/ralph/state.json';s=json.load(open(p));s['completed_since_deslop']=0;s['last_deslop_at']=datetime.datetime.now().isoformat();open(p,'w').write(json.dumps(s,indent=2)+'\n')"
   ```
3. Commit the state change (state-only changes may go directly on `main`).

This gate only ADDS scans when the loop is landing code quickly; the weekly
Monday cron on `deslop.yml` runs every area regardless, as the floor. The
scans file issues asynchronously — later wakes pick them up via `pick-next.sh`
like any other backlog item.

### Step 4 — Refill EVERY open slot now (up to `max_workers`)

Fill the pool back to full immediately — do not wait for other lanes to reach any
particular gate:
```bash
# Bounded refill: never loop more than the number of currently-free slots
# (≤ max_workers), and stop the instant an assign fails — otherwise a repeated
# "branch already used by worktree" error spins the loop (see issue #83).
slots=$(scripts/ralph/fleet.sh free)
for (( i = 0; i < slots; i++ )); do
  [ "$(scripts/ralph/fleet.sh free)" -gt 0 ] || break
  ISSUE_N=$(scripts/ralph/pick-next.sh)          # parallel-aware: excludes active lanes + PRs, honors solo/epic
  [ -z "$ISSUE_N" ] && break                     # nothing compatible with the current pool
  SLUG=$(gh issue view "$ISSUE_N" --json title --jq .title)
  if ! WT=$(scripts/ralph/fleet.sh assign "$ISSUE_N" "$SLUG"); then   # worktree off origin/main
    echo "assign failed for issue $ISSUE_N — stopping refill this tick" >&2
    break
  fi
  echo "assigned issue $ISSUE_N → $WT"
done
```
For **each** issue you just assigned, dispatch a **background** `ralph-worker`
(`run_in_background: true`), passing `RALPH_ISSUE` and `RALPH_WORKTREE=<path>`.
Its contract is `scripts/ralph/PROMPT.md` (fleet variant: branch/worktree already
exist — skip branch creation, work inside the worktree, open the PR, return).
**Launch and move on — never await a worker.** When a worker later finishes, that
completion is its own wake; a `blocked`/`failed` worker has already commented +
labelled, so `release` its worktree (`scripts/ralph/fleet.sh release "$N"`) so
the slot refills on the next wake; a `pr_opened` worker leaves its worktree in
Gate 3/4.

### Step 5 — Arm per-lane wakes, then end the turn

You want a wake the moment **any single lane** changes — not a barrier that waits
for all of them. Arrange, in this order of preference:

1. **Background workers** already wake you on their own completion — nothing to
   arm for a lane that's still building.
2. **The fleet Monitor is the PRIMARY wake source for Gates 3–4** (owner
   directive, 2026-07-05). Keep exactly ONE **persistent** `Monitor` running
   for the whole session that polls every in-flight Ralph PR (via
   `gh pr list --author "@me"` + `scripts/ralph/pr-ready.sh`) every ~90s and
   emits one event line per **state transition** — `PR#N:<old→new status>`
   (`ready`/`behind`/`pending`/`ci-failed`/`awaiting-review`) — and one line
   when a PR **disappears** (merged or closed, incl. `iteration-trigger.yml`
   auto-merges: "slot may be free, run a tick to release+refill"). Design
   rules learned the hard way (2026-07-05 incident — monitor went silent for
   30+ min while 4 PRs transitioned):
   - **Errors are isolated PER PR, never per cycle.** One PR's failed query
     must not suppress other PRs' events. Retry the failed PR once, then
     record `PR#N:query-error` — the transition to `query-error` emits
     loudly. An `ok`-flag that skips the whole cycle turns one bad PR into
     permanent, invisible silence.
   - **The Monitor shell is zsh: unquoted `$var` does NOT word-split.**
     Iterate lists with `for x in $(printf '%s\n' "$list")` (command
     substitutions DO split), never `for x in $list` — the latter passes the
     whole newline-joined list as one argument and every downstream call
     fails.
   - Seed state silently on the first pass (no spurious event); diff the
     full status map so failures emit just like successes.
   - If no fleet Monitor is running at the end of a wake (session restart,
     TaskStop, crash), arm a fresh one. If the Monitor has emitted nothing
     across a whole heartbeat interval while PRs are in flight, treat it as
     suspect: verify liveness (compare its last events against live
     `pr-ready.sh` output) and restart it if they disagree.
3. **Per-PR webhook subscriptions** (`mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity`),
   when the GitHub MCP server is available in the session, add push-grade
   latency for comment/CI-failure events. Idempotent — (re)subscribe each
   open PR every wake; unsubscribe on merge/close. They do NOT deliver CI
   success or merges, which is why the Monitor above stays primary.
4. **`ScheduleWakeup` is belt-and-suspenders, not the mechanism.** Arm a
   modest fallback (~1200–1800s) to survive the Monitor dying silently or an
   event being missed. Only if the fleet Monitor could NOT be armed (tool
   unavailable) drop the fallback to ~240–270s so refills don't degrade into
   waves gated on the slowest lane's wake. Pool empty + backlog empty →
   Mode A — announce done and stop.

Then **end the turn.** Do not run a Monitor that waits for all lanes to be
terminal — that is the barrier this design removes. Each independent wake re-runs
Step 0 and merges/refills whatever is ready.

---

## Worked example (why the slow lane never gates the fast one)

Pool of 4: issues A, B, C, D building in parallel. B is a tiny fix, D is a large
feature.
1. B finishes Gate 2.5, opens its PR; CI + review pass → B is `LGTM`+green+`CLEAN`.
2. A wake fires (B's verdict). Step 1 merges **B now** — A, C, D are untouched and
   still mid-gate. Step 4 sees a free slot and assigns **E**, launching its worker.
3. D is still at Gate 1. It never blocked B, and B's merge didn't wait for D.
4. C later goes `LGTM`+green but is now `BEHIND` (B and E landed). Step 1 syncs C;
   CI re-runs; C merges on the next wake once green. D keeps going the whole time.

Continuous throughput, four lanes always busy, merges strictly serialized and
always up-to-date.

## Sequential fallback

Set `parallel_enabled: false` (or `max_workers: 1`) in `state.json` and the pool
collapses to one lane: `fleet.sh free` reports at most 1, so Step 4 fills a single
slot and the loop behaves exactly like the classic one-issue-at-a-time Ralph —
still worktree-isolated, same gates, same drop-backs.

## Hard rules (do not deviate)
- **Merges to `main` are serialized and always up-to-date.** Merge a lane only
  when `LGTM` + green + `mergeStateStatus == CLEAN`; a `BEHIND` lane syncs first.
- **Never make a fast lane wait on a slow one.** No per-tick barrier, no
  all-lanes Monitor. Act on whichever lane a wake is about; refill freed slots
  immediately.
- **Workers are background; never await them.** `run_in_background: true`, launch
  and end the turn.
- **Never more than `max_workers` worktrees.** `fleet.sh` enforces the cap; do
  not bypass it. **One issue per worker; one worker per worktree.**
- **Never track these issues with the Task tools.** (User directive.)
- **Never write to `main` directly** except `scripts/ralph/state.json`.
- **Never force-push.** Integration is `fleet.sh sync` (a merge), never a rebase
  of a pushed branch.
- **Never disable a CI check / pre-commit hook / lower a threshold.** Fix the
  root cause. If a tool is missing for an environmental reason, install it.
- **Re-entrancy first.** Read `state.json`, `fleet.sh list`, and PR state at the
  top of every wake; derive pool state from live git + GitHub, never from memory.
- **On merge, mark the issue done** (Step 1) and bump `state.json`.
