"""Pure statistics helpers for the Ralph tick-loop recap.

Everything in this module is side-effect free: it takes already-fetched data
(lists of timestamps, verdict sequences, churn tuples) and returns plain
dicts/numbers. `recap.py` does all the GitHub / Discord / Anthropic I/O and
hands the data here. Keeping the math pure makes it unit-testable without a
network.

A "Ralph tick loop" is an autonomous agent that grinds a backlog one issue at
a time: each tick opens a PR, iterates against the Claude reviewer's verdict
until LGTM, merges, and moves to the next backlog item. These helpers turn the
merge history into the numbers a human wants to see in a recap.
