# windbreak Runbook

Operational instructions for running and observing windbreak. This runbook
grows with the project; today it covers the always-on PAPER loop shipped in
issue #48.

## Running the PAPER loop

### Prerequisites / config

The PAPER loop is one per-beat hook inside `windbreak run`'s existing RESEARCH
heartbeat loop (`windbreak/main.py`). It activates only when **both** of these
hold, checked by `_paper_activated`:

1. The active configuration's `mode_ceiling` (SPEC S16) permits `PAPER` --
   i.e. `Mode.from_config(config.mode_ceiling) is not Mode.RESEARCH`. The
   built-in default configuration (`windbreak.config.load_default_config`,
   used whenever `--config` is omitted) already ships `mode_ceiling: "paper"`,
   so no custom config is required to satisfy this condition.
2. **All four** of the following `run` flags are supplied together:

   | Flag | Meaning |
   |------|---------|
   | `--paper-books-dir` | Paper-exchange fixture directory (books/markets/fees) loaded via `PaperExchange.from_fixture_dir`. |
   | `--cassette-path` | Recorded LLM cassette file for the offline forecast-replay transport (`ReplayCassette.from_path`). |
   | `--ledger-path` | Path to the PAPER loop's hash-chained SQLite ledger database (a sibling `<name>.wal` file backs its write-ahead log). |
   | `--report-dir` | Directory the weekly report stub is written into. |

If the ceiling forbids PAPER, or even one of the four flags is missing, none
of this is wired: `windbreak run` falls back to its plain RESEARCH heartbeat
(optionally with `--snapshot-fixture-dir` snapshotting, if given) -- **byte
identical to today's behavior**. This "all four flags or nothing" gate is the
tracer invariant: partially-flagged or ceiling-mismatched invocations can
never half-activate PAPER.

**RESEARCH is the safe default.** Omitting the four PAPER flags (or setting
`mode_ceiling: research`) is always a safe, side-effect-free way to run
`windbreak run` -- no ledger is created, no paper exchange is touched.

### Starting the loop

```bash
windbreak run \
  --paper-books-dir tests/fixtures/books/deep_walk \
  --cassette-path /path/to/cassette.json \
  --ledger-path /path/to/state/ledger.db \
  --report-dir /path/to/state/reports \
  --heartbeat-interval 5
```

- `--cassette-path` must point at an existing recorded-cassette JSON file. An
  empty cassette (`{}`) is a valid, offline-safe placeholder as long as the
  forecast pipeline's research stage never actually reaches the LLM transport
  (it abstains first on zero verified citations when no research tools are
  wired) -- see `tests/integration/conftest.py` for the pattern this mirrors.
- `--ledger-path`'s parent directory must exist; the ledger file and its
  `.wal` sibling are created on first use.
- Stop the loop with `Ctrl-C` (SIGINT) or SIGTERM; it shuts down cleanly and
  logs the shutdown reason. `--max-beats N` stops it automatically after `N`
  heartbeats (useful for a bounded smoke run).

### What one PAPER tick actually does

Each beat runs one `windbreak.scheduler.loop.run_single_tick` pass over the
*real* (unmodified) components, per SPEC S5.3's SINGLE order path:

```
snapshot -> forecast -> select -> approve (seam) -> [only if a token mints]
route -> PaperExchange fill -> reconcile
```

Every stage appends an audit event to the shared hash-chained ledger, plus a
per-tick `ModeHeartbeat`, `EquitySampled`, and `PositionsSnapshotRecorded`.
The weekly report stub (below) is also (re-)written each tick.

**Known limitation -- today's tick never actually fills.** The `approve`
stage composes the real `RiskKernel.evaluate_intent` with the real
`ApprovalPipeline.approve` (`KernelApproval` in `windbreak/scheduler/loop.py`).
Right now that seam can never mint an approval token, for two independent
reasons:

- One SPEC S10.3 pre-trade check (`jurisdiction_product_eligibility`) is still
  an unconditional-veto stub.
- `exchange_status_ok` and `pipeline_heartbeat_ok` are now real checks (issue
  #110), but the loop honestly supplies no exchange-status feed and no
  pipeline heartbeat (`exchange_status=None`, `pipeline_heartbeat_epoch_s=None`),
  so both fail closed and veto today.
- The reconciliation checks fail closed on `verification=None`, which is
  exactly what the loop honestly supplies today -- no live exchange
  verification cycle runs in PAPER yet.

So a real PAPER tick ledgers a full decision trail (snapshot, forecast,
selector decision, and an `IntentVetoed`) but routes nothing and fills
nothing; `filled_centis` on every tick's outcome is `0`. Don't be surprised
to see nothing but vetoes in `/decisions` or `selector_decisions.json` --
that is the expected, honestly-ledgered state of the loop today. The first
real, kernel-approved paper fill activates once the remaining stub is retired
and live exchange-status, heartbeat, and verification feeds are wired into the
loop in place of today's fail-closed `None`s.

**Known limitation -- the kill switch does not stop the PAPER loop yet.**
`windbreak kill --state-dir <dir>` and `windbreak rearm --state-dir <dir>` write
and clear a `KILL`/`REARM` file, but the PAPER loop's `RiskKernel` is
constructed with `kill_integration=None` (`windbreak/scheduler/loop.py`), so no
kill-file watcher is polled. To stop the loop today, stop the process itself
(`Ctrl-C`/SIGINT or SIGTERM).

### Acknowledging a held order (LIVE_MICRO / LIVE)

In the live modes, an order whose worst-case cost exceeds
`risk.require_human_ack_above_micros` is **held** — not routed — until an
operator explicitly acknowledges it (SPEC S10.8). Each held order opens a
pending acknowledgement with a single-use, unguessable 32-hex `approval_id` and
a ttl; if nobody acknowledges it before the ttl, the approval lapses and its
capital reservation is released. Every request, grant, and lapse is ledgered.

Two operator paths grant an acknowledgement, both drop-box based (they work with
the dashboard HTTP surface down, mirroring `kill`/`rearm`):

```bash
windbreak ack --approval-id <32-hex-approval-id> --state-dir <dir>
```

writes `<dir>/acks/<approval_id>`, which the kernel's ack-file watcher grants on
its next beat and then removes. The `--approval-id` must be exactly 32 lowercase
hex characters (the shape the kernel mints); any other token is rejected as a
usage error before a file is written. Alternatively, `POST /ack` on the
dashboard (below) grants the same acknowledgement over the authenticated
loopback surface. As with the kill switch, the live loop that polls the ack
drop-box is not wired yet — this verb writes the durable grant signal a future
live loop consumes.

### Observing via the dashboard

`windbreak.dashboard.app` serves a read-only, loopback-only HTTP surface:

- Binds `127.0.0.1` only (never a public interface -- not configurable, per
  SPEC S14).
- Every route requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (timing-safe compared
  against the token `create_server(token=...)` was built with); a
  missing/wrong token gets a `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`
  challenge.

Routes:

| Path | Renders |
|------|---------|
| `/` | Current mode and last-heartbeat status. |
| `/positions` | The latest open-positions snapshot. |
| `/equity` | The equity curve vs. the configured capital floor. |
| `/decisions` | The interleaved selector decisions, including skip/veto reasons. |
| `/providers` | The fleet-observability provider panel: one summary per provider (id, canary status; resolved count, Brier skill, and abstention rate render `n/a` from this source, issue #195) plus a fleet-wide cost-per-forecast line. See [Provider operations](#provider-operations) below. |
| `GET /acks` | The pending human acknowledgements awaiting an operator (SPEC S10.8). |
| `POST /ack` | Grant a pending acknowledgement — JSON body `{"approval_id": "<32-hex>"}`. |

`POST /ack` is the dashboard's only write surface: it shares the same bearer
gate as every read route (an unauthenticated post gets a `401` and never
reaches the granter), 404s when `create_server` was built with no `ack_granter`
seam wired, and rejects a malformed, oversized, or non-32-hex body with a `400`
before invoking the granter. It is enabled only when both `ack_granter` and
`pending_acks_source` are passed to `create_server`; the default build exposes
neither route.

`windbreak run --process dashboard` is the primary operator path (issue #79).
The bearer token is read only from the `WINDBREAK_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` environment
variable -- never from config, since config is ledgered and a secret would
leak into the hash chain -- and a missing or blank value fails closed with a
`FATAL` log and exit code 1. The listen port comes from `config.dashboard.port`
(default `8080`); the host is always the loopback `127.0.0.1` and is not
configurable. Passing `--ledger-path` wires the status line and every
read-model view to that ledger (the same one `windbreak rebuild` projects);
omit it and `/` reports `RESEARCH` / `never` with every view rendering its "no
data yet" placeholder:

```bash
export WINDBREAK_DASHBOARD_TOKEN=replace-with-a-real-secret
windbreak run --process dashboard --ledger-path /path/to/state/ledger.db
```

Embedding the server directly in a library caller -- bypassing the CLI
entirely -- is also supported via `create_server`:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from windbreak.dashboard.app import create_server
from windbreak.dashboard.views import build_ledger_read_models_source

server = create_server(
    token="replace-with-a-real-secret",
    status_source=lambda: ...,  # wire to a real status source
    read_models_source=build_ledger_read_models_source(Path("/path/to/state/ledger.db")),
    port=8765,
)
server.serve_forever()
```

Until the loop has ledgered data, `/positions`, `/equity`, and `/decisions`
each render a plain "No data yet." placeholder rather than an empty table or
an error -- this is the documented behavior, not a bug. Passing no
`read_models_source` at all (the default) renders that same placeholder on
every view unconditionally.

### Observing via ledger read models

`windbreak rebuild` folds a verified ledger into a set of byte-stable JSON
read-model files -- the same projection functions the dashboard reads live:

```bash
windbreak rebuild --ledger-path /path/to/state/ledger.db --output-dir /path/to/state/read-models
```

This writes (or overwrites) ten files into `--output-dir`:

- `config_versions.json` -- every `ConfigLoaded` event.
- `mode_history.json` -- every `ModeHeartbeat` event.
- `gateway_events.json` -- the chronological Order Gateway / crash-recovery
  event trail.
- `positions.json` -- the latest `PositionsSnapshotRecorded` snapshot (at
  most one entry).
- `equity_curve.json` -- every `EquitySampled` sample, in ledger order.
- `selector_decisions.json` -- the interleaved `SelectorDecisionRecorded` /
  `IntentApproved` / `IntentVetoed` trail, in ledger order.
- `execution_quality.json` -- every `ExecutionQualityRecorded` row, in ledger
  order (issue #58).
- `live_divergence.json` -- the interleaved `LiveDivergenceSampled` /
  `LiveDivergenceBreached` trail, in ledger order (issue #58).
- `canary_status.json` -- the LATEST `CanaryVerdictRecorded` per provider,
  keyed at that provider's first-seen list position (issue #195; see
  [Provider operations](#provider-operations) below).
- `forecasts.json` -- every `ForecastCreated` row, in ledger order (issue
  #195), feeding the fleet cost-per-forecast/abstention fold.

`rebuild` verifies the ledger's hash chain before projecting; a corrupted
chain fails closed with a nonzero exit code and the offending sequence number
on stderr, rather than silently emitting a plausible-but-wrong projection.

### Anchoring and verifying against tail-rewrite tampering (issue #75)

`verify_chain`/`rebuild` prove the ledger is *internally* consistent, but
cannot distinguish a legitimately short chain from one whose tail a writer
with raw database access truncated and re-chained -- both verify cleanly.
Head-hash anchoring closes that gap: `windbreak anchor` appends the chain's
current head `(sequence_number, event_hash)` to an append-only, JSON-lines
anchor file, and `windbreak verify` independently checks the live chain
against every anchor recorded so far.

```bash
windbreak anchor --ledger-path /path/to/state/ledger.db --anchor-path /path/to/anchors/ledger.anchors.jsonl
windbreak verify --ledger-path /path/to/state/ledger.db --anchor-path /path/to/anchors/ledger.anchors.jsonl
```

Both verify the hash chain first (a corrupted chain fails closed with the
offending sequence number, exactly like `rebuild`); `windbreak anchor` is a
silent no-op against an empty ledger, and never anchors a broken chain.
`windbreak verify` additionally fails closed if the anchor file is missing,
empty, or holds a malformed line, and reports the first anchored position
whose live hash no longer matches -- or has vanished entirely -- as a
tail-rewrite mismatch on stderr.

**Trust boundary.** The anchor file only relocates the trust root; it does
not eliminate it. The guarantee holds only while the anchor file is
protected from whoever can write to the ledger database -- a writer with
access to *both* can truncate the chain, re-chain a forged tail, and append a
fresh anchor pinning the forged head, and both commands would pass. Put the
anchor file on a separately-permissioned volume, an append-only/write-once
medium, or a remote/off-host sink the ledger writer cannot reach; anchoring
next to the ledger under the same principal only catches accidental
corruption, not a determined local attacker.

### Weekly reports

Each PAPER tick calls `windbreak.reports.weekly.maybe_write_weekly`, which
writes at most one `weekly-YYYY-MM-DD.md` file per ISO calendar week into
`--report-dir` (idempotent: repeated calls within the same ISO week return the
already-written file untouched). The stub carries markdown section headers
(`Equity vs floor`, `Positions`, `Decisions`) each with a `No data yet.` body
-- populating the real bodies from ledgered data is a later documentation
pass.

### Known limitations (summary)

- The real Risk Kernel currently vetoes every intent (the
  `jurisdiction_product_eligibility` check is still an unconditional-veto stub;
  the now-real `exchange_status_ok`/`pipeline_heartbeat_ok` checks and the
  reconciliation checks all fail closed on the `None` status/heartbeat/
  verification the loop honestly supplies), so no PAPER tick fills yet --
  expect vetoes, not fills, in the ledger and dashboard.
- `windbreak kill`/`windbreak rearm` do not stop or gate the PAPER loop today
  (`kill_integration=None`); use process signals to stop the loop.
- `windbreak run --process dashboard` boots the HTTP dashboard server directly
  (issue #79); its bearer token comes only from `WINDBREAK_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`
  and its port only from `config.dashboard.port` -- there is no `--port` or
  `--token` CLI flag.
- Weekly reports are structural stubs (`No data yet.` bodies); the real
  report content is a later pass.

## Provider operations

Fleet-observability provider canaries (issue #195, SPEC S8.4/S16 extended
per-provider) run one small reference battery per forecast provider and
ledger every verdict, so silent per-provider answer drift or forecaster
version drift is caught before it poisons a live forecast. The battery is
driven entirely by the operator-run `scripts/run-canaries.sh` (a thin wrapper
over `scripts/run_canaries.py`, which owns every `requests`/environment
access on this path -- CI never dials a live forecaster) -- never by CI, and
never by the PAPER/live heartbeat loop itself (see the known limitation at
the end of this section).

A battery is described by a `--spec-file` JSON document: a `"providers"` list,
each entry carrying `provider`, `questions` (a list of
`{"question_id", "prompt", "reference_ppm"}` objects), `pinned_versions` (the
operator-accepted forecaster version strings for that provider), and either an
`"observation"` object (`{"observed_ppm": {...}, "reported_version": "..."}`,
replay mode) or an `"endpoint"`/`"host"` pair (record mode; the outbound URL
must resolve to `host` exactly, or the run fails closed with
`EgressDeniedError`).

### Rotate provider keys

In `--record` mode, each provider's live API key is read from its
`<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` environment variable (the provider identifier
upper-cased plus the `_API_KEY` suffix, e.g. `FUTURESEARCH_API_KEY` --
`scripts/run_canaries.py`'s `_API_KEY_ENV_SUFFIX` constant), injected as an
`x-api-key` send-time HTTP header, and never printed, logged, or written to
any cassette or ledger row.

1. Export the new key under that exact variable name -- never a literal in
   any command, script, or commit:

   ```bash
   export FUTURESEARCH_API_KEY=replace-with-a-real-key
   ```

2. Validate the rotation by re-running that provider's battery in record
   mode, which dials the live endpoint once with the new key:

   ```bash
   scripts/run-canaries.sh --record \
       --spec-file provider_canaries.record.json \
       --ledger-path var/ledger.db
   ```

3. Confirm the process exits `0` and prints `provider=<name> canary=OK
   drift_score_ppm=<n>` for the rotated provider (the exact
   `provider=<p> canary=<STATUS> drift_score_ppm=<n>` line every verdict
   prints). A wrong or expired key surfaces as a live HTTP failure from the
   provider's endpoint, not a silent pass; a genuine drift line (`ANSWER_DRIFT`
   / `VERSION_DRIFT`) means the key worked but the provider itself drifted --
   treat that as [drift](#respond-to-canary-drift--provider-version-drift), not
   a rotation failure.
4. Revoke the old key at the provider's own dashboard once the new key is
   confirmed working; this script cannot do that for you.

Never echo the key value in any of the above -- the script deliberately never
prints it either (`scripts/run-canaries.sh`'s own `--record` banner names the
required variable, not its value).

### Respond to canary drift / provider version drift

A drift breach dispatches one `AlertType.CANARY_DRIFT` alert and ledgers one
`CanaryVerdictRecorded` event (`status` one of `OK` / `ANSWER_DRIFT` /
`VERSION_DRIFT`). Running via `scripts/run-canaries.sh`, the alert prints to
stderr as `ALERT AlertType.CANARY_DRIFT: <message>` and the process exits `1`
the moment any provider drifts:

- An answer-drift message reads `Provider <p> answer-drift: Canary drift <n>
  ppm exceeded tolerance <t> ppm; worst question <id>`.
- A version-drift message reads `Provider <p> version-drift: reported
  forecaster version '<v>' is off the pinned set [...]`.

1. **Read the alert** to identify the provider and the drift kind
   (`answer` vs. `version`).
2. **Inspect durable state** -- either the ledger read models:

   ```bash
   windbreak rebuild --ledger-path var/ledger.db --output-dir var/read-models
   cat var/read-models/canary_status.json    # latest verdict per provider
   ```

   or the live dashboard's `/providers` route, started with
   `windbreak run --process dashboard --ledger-path var/ledger.db` and
   bearer-gated via `WINDBREAK_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` (see
   [Observing via the dashboard](#observing-via-the-dashboard) above), which
   folds the same `canary_status.json` / `forecasts.json` projections through
   `render_provider_panel`.
3. **For VERSION drift**, decide: accept the new version by adding it to that
   provider's `pinned_versions` list in the canary `--spec-file`, or treat it
   as a vendor regression and investigate upstream before accepting anything.
   (FutureSearch's *live* forecaster has its own, separate pin --
   `config.forecast.futuresearch.pinned_forecaster_versions` -- which gates
   real forecasts, not the canary battery; update it too if the version bump
   is legitimate for live forecasting, not only for canaries.)
4. **For ANSWER drift**, investigate the underlying prompt/response
   regression (a silent vendor model swap not reflected in the reported
   version, a prompt-template change, etc.).
5. **Re-run the battery until it exits `0`**:

   ```bash
   scripts/run-canaries.sh --spec-file provider_canaries.json --ledger-path var/ledger.db
   ```

   every printed line should read `canary=OK`.

Per SPEC S8.6, `CanaryGate.is_live_blocked` is fail-closed and never
auto-adapts: a drifting provider is blocked from live eligibility until an
operator acknowledges it (`CanaryGate.acknowledge`), and a breach on the
*global* (pinned-canary-model) dimension blocks every provider closed, not
just the one that drifted -- a provider query ORs its own window with the
global one.

**Known limitation -- no persistent, wired gate to acknowledge against yet.**
`scripts/run_canaries.py`'s CLI never passes a `gate=` argument to
`windbreak.scheduler.canaries.run_canaries`, so each invocation of
`scripts/run-canaries.sh` scores against a brand-new, in-memory `CanaryGate()`
-- there is no cross-run block state, and therefore nothing to acknowledge via
this script. `CanaryGate.acknowledge()` is a real, tested primitive (used
directly by the test suite) that a future, persistent composition root will
drive, but no `windbreak` CLI verb or dashboard route calls it today. The
practical operator loop today is exactly steps 3-5 above: fix the root cause
(or accept the version), then re-run the battery until every provider reads
`canary=OK`. Separately, `windbreak.forecast.pipeline.run_pipeline`'s own
`canary_gate` seam is real and unit-tested, but `windbreak/scheduler/loop.py`'s
PAPER-tick `_forecast_stage` calls `run_pipeline(...)` without a `canary_gate`
argument -- so canary drift does not yet block a live PAPER-loop tick
end-to-end; today the battery is a standalone, operator-run detector, not (yet)
an in-loop gate.

### Respond to budget exhaustion

`windbreak.forecast.budget.ResearchBudget` enforces SPEC S16's three research
spend ceilings, mirrored in config at `config.forecast.budget.per_forecast_micros`
(default 3,000,000 micros / $3), `config.forecast.budget.per_day_micros`
(default 20,000,000 micros / $20), and `config.forecast.budget.max_pages`
(default 20 pages per forecast). Two events name the two ways a run can be
halted:

- `BUDGET_DAY_EXHAUSTED` -- `ResearchBudget.ensure_day_open` halts a run
  **before any research is attempted** once the current UTC day's cumulative
  spend is at or above the per-day ceiling; raises `DailyBudgetExhaustedError`.
- `BUDGET_FORECAST_EXCEEDED` -- `ResearchBudget.charge_forecast` charges a
  single forecast's cost into the day bucket **first** (so a breaching
  forecast still counts against the day), then raises
  `PerForecastBudgetExceededError` only if that forecast's own cost *strictly
  exceeds* the per-forecast ceiling (an exactly-equal cost passes).

The day bucket is keyed by the run's UTC calendar date
(`datetime.astimezone(UTC).date().isoformat()`) -- it resets, not decays, at
each UTC midnight; there is no manual reset lever and no partial-day rollover.

When either error is raised: check which UTC day is exhausted (the error's
`utc_day` field) and how much was spent (`spent_micros`/`cost_micros` vs.
`budget_micros`); a day-exhaustion halt clears itself automatically at the
next UTC midnight, while a per-forecast breach is a signal to look at that
one forecast's research cost (an unusually expensive research stage, a
runaway page-fetch loop bounded by `max_pages`, etc.) rather than the whole
day's spend.

**Known limitation -- not wired into the live loop yet.** `ResearchBudget` is
a real, tested guard, but `windbreak/scheduler/loop.py`'s PAPER-tick
`_forecast_stage` calls `run_pipeline(...)` without a `budget` argument, so
neither `BUDGET_DAY_EXHAUSTED` nor `BUDGET_FORECAST_EXCEEDED` fires in
today's running PAPER loop. The class is reachable today only by a caller
that constructs a `ResearchBudget` directly and passes it to
`run_pipeline(..., budget=ResearchBudget(ledger=...))` -- wiring a real,
ledgered `ResearchBudget` into the composition root is a later pass.

### Add / remove a provider

**Adding** a provider to the canary battery:

1. Add its entry to the canary `--spec-file` JSON's `"providers"` list:
   `provider`, `questions` (one `{"question_id", "prompt", "reference_ppm"}`
   object per reference question), and `pinned_versions`.
2. Record and validate its first live observation once, in record mode (see
   [Rotate provider keys](#rotate-provider-keys) above for the key-export
   step) -- this is the only "recording" step provider canaries have; it is
   distinct from, and does not use, the LLM vote-ensemble cassette recorders
   (`scripts/record-cassettes.sh`, `scripts/record-research-cassettes.sh`,
   issues #191/#192), which record a different surface (ensemble-member vote
   completions, not provider canary endpoints):

   ```bash
   scripts/run-canaries.sh --record \
       --spec-file provider_canaries.record.json \
       --ledger-path var/ledger.db
   ```

3. Run the full battery in (the default, offline) replay mode and confirm the
   new provider's line reads `canary=OK`:

   ```bash
   scripts/run-canaries.sh --spec-file provider_canaries.json --ledger-path var/ledger.db
   ```

4. Confirm it appears:

   ```bash
   windbreak rebuild --ledger-path var/ledger.db --output-dir var/read-models
   ```

   then check `var/read-models/canary_status.json` for the new `"provider"`
   entry, or hit the dashboard's `/providers` route, or check the weekly
   report's `## Providers` section (`windbreak.reports.providers`'s
   `provider=<p> resolved=<n> ...` line) once that section is wired to real
   data (see the known limitation below).

**Retiring** a provider:

1. Remove its entry from the `--spec-file` so future battery runs stop
   appending fresh verdicts for it.

**Known limitation -- retirement leaves a stale, not an absent, entry.** The
`canary_status.json` fold (`canary_status_read_model`) is append-only and
keeps the LATEST verdict per provider ever ledgered; there is no tombstone or
removal event. A retired provider's last verdict therefore stays visible in
`canary_status.json` and on the `/providers` dashboard panel indefinitely --
"confirm it is gone" is not literally achievable with today's tooling.
Instead, treat a `canary_status.json` / `GET /providers` entry whose
`created_at` predates the retirement date as the retirement signal, until a
future retirement/tombstone mechanism ships. Similarly, the weekly report's
`## Providers` section (`windbreak.reports.providers.render_provider_lines`)
is a real, unit-tested renderer, but no production composition root supplies
its `provider_lines` argument yet (`windbreak/scheduler/loop.py` writes the
PAPER-loop's weekly report via the plain `maybe_write_weekly` stub path, not
`windbreak.evaluation.report.generate_weekly_report`) -- so today the weekly
report's `## Providers` section always renders its `No data yet.` fallback,
regardless of what the ledger holds.
