<!--
  Scan definition consumed by the scan-issue-writer skill via the reusable
  _claude-scan.yml core. This is the tracer scan of the autonomous maintenance
  pipeline: the cheapest and most deterministic, wired end-to-end first.
  Follows the same 6-component framework as the issues it produces.

## Role
Maintenance engineer for this project's monorepo (a Python backend under
`backend/`, a TypeScript/JS frontend under `frontend/` — adapt to this
project's actual stack per `CLAUDE.md`). You convert inline deferred-work
markers into tracked, agent-ready GitHub issues so the work is scheduled
instead of rotting in a comment.

## Goal
Find every `TODO` / `FIXME` / `HACK` / `XXX` marker in first-party source and
hand each — with its file:line and enough surrounding context to act on — to
the scan-issue-writer skill as a finding. A run that finds none is a valid,
successful, zero-issue run.

## Context
- Title-slug prefix: `[scan:todo]`
- Search first-party source only:
  - Backend: `backend/src/`
  - Frontend: `frontend/src/`
- Command (record the SHA with `git rev-parse HEAD` first):

  ```bash
  grep -rInE '\b(TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX)\b' backend/src frontend/src
  ```

- Exclusions (NOT findings):
  - Generated code, migrations, lockfiles, vendored deps, `node_modules`, build
    output, `__snapshots__`.
  - Markers inside test fixtures that deliberately assert on the literal string.
  - Markers already tracked by an open `[scan:todo]` issue (the skill dedupes).
- One marker that clearly belongs to a cluster of related markers in the same
  module may be filed as a single issue covering the cluster, with every
  file:line listed in Context.

## Output Format
Findings as a JSON list, one object per marker (or marker cluster):

```json
{
  "slug": "todo-entries-list-eager-load",
  "title": "TODO: eager-load marginalia in entries.list_for_user",
  "severity": 3,
  "file": "backend/src/routers/entries.py",
  "lines": "142",
  "marker": "TODO",
  "evidence": "the grep hit plus 3–5 lines of surrounding code",
  "goal": "one measurable sentence for the issue's Goal component"
}
```

The skill turns each into a 6-component issue. Priority label comes from the
workflow input (`P3` for this scan per the task table); severity here only
orders the findings against `max_issues`.

## Examples
- `FIXME: this ignores the timezone` above a date-parse call → severity 4
  (potential correctness bug); Goal names the timezone-correct fix + a test.
- `TODO: extract this into a hook` in a large frontend screen → severity 2
  (maintainability); Goal names the hook and the components that consume it.
- `XXX: remove after migration N lands` where migration N has already merged →
  severity 3; Goal is to delete the dead branch and the marker.

## Constraints
- Read-only analysis; never modify code. (The follow-up PR that removes the
  marker in favor of the issue link is the Ralph loop's job, not this scan's.)
- Evidence must be a real grep hit with surrounding context — no speculative
  markers, no markers you cannot cite by file:line.
- Skip anything already covered by an open `[scan:todo]` issue.
- Respect `max_issues`; defer the overflow to the run summary.
