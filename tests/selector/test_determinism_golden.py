"""Golden determinism harness for hedgekit.selector.select (issues #43/#44/#45).

The whole point of this module: `select` + `serialize_decision` over a fixed
input must produce byte-identical output every time it is called, in-process
or from a brand-new interpreter, regardless of `PYTHONHASHSEED`. Four layers
of proof, from weakest to strongest:

1. `test_select_is_byte_identical_on_recorded_inputs` -- the issue's own
   verbatim claim: two in-process calls over the same recorded bundle agree.
2. `test_bundle_a_decision_emits_exactly_one_named_yes_buy_intent` -- pins the
   *shape* of issue #44's real selection logic on bundle A: SPEC S9.1-S9.3
   evaluate every named condition into `reasons` (never silently empty) and,
   because bundle A hand-verifiably passes all twelve (see the per-condition
   values in `tests/selector/fixtures/bundle_a.json` against
   `tests/selector/test_entry_conditions.py`'s baseline scenario), emit
   exactly one `"yes"`/`"buy"` intent -- superseding the issue-#43 stub's
   "always zero intents" pin now that real selection logic exists (SPEC
   S9.2-S9.3, issue #44).
3. `test_serialized_output_matches_committed_golden` -- compares against a
   *committed* golden file, so a silent change to field order/formatting is
   caught even if it happens to still be self-consistent.
4. `test_fresh_interpreter_produces_identical_bytes` -- runs `select` in a
   brand-new `python -c` subprocess (a different `PYTHONHASHSEED` than this
   process) and diffs its stdout bytes against the in-process serialization,
   ruling out any accidental dependence on hash-seed-influenced iteration
   order (e.g. an un-sorted dict/set) that a same-process comparison could
   never expose.

Golden newline convention (hook-stability): ``serialize_decision`` returns
canonical JSON with **no** trailing newline, but this repo's own
``end-of-file-fixer`` pre-commit hook requires every committed text file to
end in exactly one ``"\n"``. To keep a freshly regenerated golden stable
under that hook (rather than exempting the fixtures, which would weaken the
hook), each ``fixtures/*.golden`` file stores the serialized bytes **plus a
single trailing ``"\n"``**. The comparison below re-appends that newline to
the live serialized output before diffing, and
`test_committed_golden_is_hook_stable` pins the invariant so a regenerated
golden is always exactly ``serialize_decision(...) + "\n"``.

Golden-file regeneration: the two `fixtures/*.golden` files committed
alongside this module hold real `select` output, regenerated from an actual
`select`/`serialize_decision` run (never hand-fabricated) -- bundle A at the
post-#45 sized shape (see the issue-#45 note below), bundle B at the #44 shape
(it declines before sizing). Bundle A hand-verifiably passes all twelve SPEC
S9.3 conditions (per
`test_bundle_a_decision_emits_exactly_one_named_yes_buy_intent` above) and so
emits one real, Kelly-sized intent; bundle B declines for four named
reasons -- `net_edge_
min` (gross edge is already negative: probability 310_000 ppm vs. the walked
executable price 320_000 ppm), `annualized_hurdle` (the resulting negative net
edge annualizes below the configured hurdle), `ci_straddles_executable_price`
(its CI [250_000, 380_000] straddles the 320_000 ppm executable price), and
`forecast_live_eligible` (`eligible_for_live=False`, forced by its
`abstention_reason`). Regenerate either golden the same way after any change
to `select`'s logic or these bundles' fixtures -- never hand-fabricate the
bytes, and always append the single trailing newline the convention requires:

    python -c "
    from tests.selector.fixture_loader import load_inputs
    from hedgekit.selector import select, serialize_decision
    path = 'tests/selector/fixtures/bundle_a'
    bytes_ = serialize_decision(select(load_inputs(path + '.json')))
    open(path + '.golden', 'w').write(bytes_ + '\n')
    "

(substitute ``bundle_b`` for the second file).

Issue #45 (dispersion-scaled Kelly sizing): bundle A's ``positions`` object
(equity/capital huge, every exposure and ``notional_today`` zero -- see
``tests/selector/fixtures/bundle_a.json``) is deliberately generous enough
that none of the five notional caps or the participation cap ever bind, so
Kelly sizing alone determines bundle A's emitted size. Hand computation, off
the probe-size (100-centi) figures already pinned in
``test_entry_conditions.py``'s bundle-A cross-reference (probability
620_000 ppm, executable price 460_000 ppm, net edge
`research_cost_adjusted_edge_ppm` 110_000 ppm):

    g = dispersion_scale(vote_dispersion_ppm=40_000, ceiling=200_000)
      = divide((200_000-40_000)*1_000_000, 200_000, floor) = 800_000
    stake_micros = divide(100_000_000*110_000*100_000*800_000,
                           540_000*10**12, floor)
                 = divide(8.8*10**23, 5.4*10**17, floor) = 1_629_629
    raw_size_centis = divide(1_629_629*100, 460_000, floor)
                    = divide(162_962_900, 460_000, floor) = 354
        (460_000*354=162_840_000; remainder=122_900 < 460_000)
    No cap binds (`binding_cap=None`) -> floor-to-100 quantization takes
    354 -> 300 -- bundle A's real, post-issue-#45 emitted size is
    `ContractCentis(300)`, priced at the re-walked marginal 4_600 pips
    (still within the book's now-deepened first level; unchanged from the
    probe's own marginal price, since 300 <= 50_000).

`bundle_a.golden` has been regenerated (via the command above) to this
post-#45 sized shape (`intent_id` suffix `:sized`, `size=300`, thirteen
reasons ending in the pinned ``sizing: raw_centis=354 g_ppm=800000
binding_cap=none final_centis=300`` line), so
`test_serialized_output_matches_committed_golden[bundle_a]` and
`test_fresh_interpreter_produces_identical_bytes[bundle_a]` pass against it.

Issue #46 (execution style) adds three serialized fields to bundle A's emitted
intent -- ``execution_style`` and the ``resting_ttl_seconds`` /
``cancel_on_move_ticks`` pair -- so the regenerated `bundle_a.golden` intent
object now also carries ``"execution_style":"cross"`` with both resting fields
serialized as JSON ``null`` (bundle A's recorded book has a 200-pip spread,
narrower than the 300-pip wide-spread floor, so it crosses rather than rests).
The intent's price (4600), size (300), idempotency key, and all thirteen
reasons are byte-unchanged; only the three sorted keys are new.

`bundle_b.golden` is byte-unchanged from the #44 shape: bundle B declines at
the entry conditions, before sizing runs, so it emits no intent and its
serialized decision -- which carries the new execution-style fields only inside
an emitted intent -- is identical. Regenerate either golden the same way (never
hand-fabricate) after any change to `select`'s logic or these bundles'
fixtures.
