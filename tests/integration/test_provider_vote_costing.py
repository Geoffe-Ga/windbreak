"""End-to-end tests for the scheduler's per-provider vote-cost ledgering
(issue #281, RED): `windbreak.scheduler.loop._forecast_stage` must append one
`ProviderVoteRecorded` event per ensemble member driven, each carrying the
tick's own `forecast_id`, immediately after its `ForecastCreated`.

`windbreak.ledger.events.ProviderVoteRecorded` does not exist yet, so the
positive-vote-reaching test below fails collection with `ImportError: cannot
import name 'ProviderVoteRecorded' from 'windbreak.ledger.events'` -- the
expected Gate 1 RED state for issue #281. The zero-events (abstain-before-
vote-stage) scenario collects fine today (it asserts an ABSENCE, not an
import) but fails with a genuine `AssertionError` once
`ProviderVoteRecorded` exists and something starts emitting it incorrectly
-- today it is a vacuous "still zero, as always" pass, which is fine: this
suite's positive test is what actually pins the missing behavior.

Two scenarios:

1. `test_zero_verified_citations_path_ledgers_zero_provider_vote_recorded`
   -- the shared `tests/integration/conftest.py` offline defaults
   (`NullSearchTransport`, zero citations) abstain BEFORE the vote stage
   (`ABSTENTION_NO_VERIFIED_CITATIONS`), so `collect_model_votes` -- and
   therefore the vote-cost ledgering it will carry -- is never reached: zero
   `ProviderVoteRecorded` events, matching the pre-existing
   `FORECAST_OUTPUT_DISCARDED`-is-also-absent contract this same offline
   fixture already proves elsewhere.
2. `test_one_paper_tick_ledgers_one_provider_vote_recorded_per_ensemble_member`
   -- a real, citation-producing research double plus a real, vote-producing
   LLM transport double drive `_forecast_stage` all the way through
   aggregation: exactly `len(DEFAULT_VOTE_ENSEMBLE)` (three)
   `ProviderVoteRecorded` events, each stamped `component="scheduler"` and
   `forecast_id` equal to the tick's own `ForecastCreated.forecast_id`.

Local-doubles choice
    This module defines its own `_FixtureSearchTransport` /
    `_FixtureFetchTransport` / `_FakeVoteTransport` doubles rather than
    importing `tests/forecast/conftest.py`'s near-identical ones --
    cross-test-package imports are not supported under this project's
    rootdir-relative pytest import mode (see `tests/forecast/conftest.py`'s
    and `tests/forecast/test_triage.py`'s docstrings for the same convention
    applied elsewhere); this module also redefines a narrow `_build_deps`
    helper rather than importing `test_paper_loop.py`'s private one, for the
    same reason.
