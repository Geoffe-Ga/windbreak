"""End-to-end failing-first tests for the always-on PAPER loop (issue #48, RED).

`windbreak.scheduler.loop` does not exist yet, so every test below fails at
collection or call time with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'windbreak.scheduler'` -- the expected Gate 1 RED state for issue #48.

Three scenarios, per the issue's own test-writing brief:

1. `test_real_kernel_tick_...` -- a full tick, wired with the *real*,
   unmodified `RiskKernel`/`ApprovalPipeline` (via `KernelApproval`), ledgers
   the full per-stage event sequence and never mints a token when the
   selector emits an intent (the `jurisdiction_product_eligibility` hard-veto
   stub, `exchange_status_ok` / `pipeline_heartbeat_ok` failing closed on
   `build_evaluation_context`'s honest `None` PAPER wiring (issue #110), plus
   the `verification=None` reconciliation fail-closed). This test's hard,
   unconditional assertions are the ledger *structure* (every stage event
   fires, the chain verifies, and two runs are content-identical); its
   `IntentVetoed`-carries-the-known-reasons assertion is *conditional* on the
   selector having emitted an intent at all. That condition is intentionally
   soft: whether the stock, unmodified forecast pipeline's fixed
   `research_cost_micros` (amortized against the selector's fixed 1-contract
   probe fill, `windbreak/selector/__init__.py::_PROBE_SIZE_CENTIS`) ever
   clears `net_edge_min` for *any* market/forecast combination is a real,
   open economic-modeling question this issue does not resolve -- orthogonal
   to what #48 composes. `tests/scheduler/test_loop.py`'s
   `test_kernel_approval_vetoes_before_minting_any_token` is this suite's
   *unconditional* proof of the load-bearing constraint (issue #110), built
   directly on the real kernel/pipeline with a hand-supplied intent, so the
   guarantee does not depend on this uncertainty.
2. `test_two_real_kernel_ticks_are_content_deterministic` -- the same tick,
   run twice over two independent `PaperTickDeps` (separate ledger paths,
   identical inputs and injected clock), ledgers byte-for-byte identical
   `(event_type, payload)` sequences.
3. `test_fill_leg_via_doubled_approval_seam_reaches_a_terminal_gateway_state`
   -- a test-level seam double standing in for `ApprovalSeam`, minting a
   *genuinely signed* `SignedApprovalToken` against `deps.verification_key`
   (the exact token-mint idiom `tests/order_gateway/conftest.py` already
   ships), proving the real `OrderGateway` -> `PaperExchange` -> `Reconciler`
   wiring `build_paper_deps` assembles -- not a production bypass, since the
   real Gateway still verifies the token's signature and the real exchange
   still fills the order.
4. `test_run_single_tick_weekly_report_wires_live_forecast`
   (issue #188, RED -- today `run_single_tick` still calls
   `render_weekly_report(today=report_date, evaluation=None, costs=None)`
   verbatim, so this test fails with an `AssertionError`: the on-disk report
   it writes still shows the bare `No data yet.` placeholder under both new
   sections, never the tick's own `forecast_id` or cost total) --
   `run_single_tick` must fold the *real* ledger (via
   `windbreak.scheduler.weekly_data.weekly_report_body`) into the weekly
   report it writes instead: the on-disk report's `## Evaluation` section
   must name the tick's own `forecast_id`, and the `## Cost meter` section's
   total must equal that forecast's ledgered `research_cost_micros`.
5. `test_tracer_invariant_research_ceiling_ledgers_only_config_loaded` -- with
   `mode_ceiling: research` (even with every PAPER flag supplied), `windbreak
   run` never wires the PAPER loop: the ledger at `--ledger-path` holds
   exactly one `ConfigLoaded` record (issue #74's unconditional
   config-load-appends-`ConfigLoaded` contract) and zero PAPER events, and
   the RESEARCH heartbeat output is unaffected. The PAPER-gating invariant
   itself -- RESEARCH ceiling never wires the PAPER loop -- is unchanged from
   issue #48; only the superseded "no ledger file at all" proxy assertion is
   corrected to match #74's ledger-on-every-config-load semantics.
