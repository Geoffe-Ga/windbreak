"""Pure SPEC S11.5 invariant checkers for the Order Gateway chaos suite (#42).

Four invariants must hold after *every* chaos scenario reaches quiescence
(``OrderGateway.recover()`` -> ``Reconciler.run_once()``/``run()`` to fixpoint
-> ``Sweeper.sweep_once()``/``run()`` to fixpoint):

    1. :func:`assert_no_duplicate_live_orders` -- no two currently-resting
       venue orders share one content-addressed ``client_order_id``.
    2. :func:`assert_no_tokenless_orders` -- every currently-resting venue
       order traces back to a Gateway-verified, WAL-journalled submission (or
       is explicitly flagged by a durable ``ReconciliationHalted`` -- a
       fail-closed halt is convergence, not a live, unaccounted-for order).
    3. :func:`assert_no_net_short_positions` -- no ticker's held quantity is
       negative, unless a durable ``ReduceOnlyViolation`` halt names that
       *exact* ticker (the fail-closed halt *is* the safe outcome the
       invariant demands, but only for the ticker it names -- an unrelated
       ticker's short with no violation naming it still fails).
    4. :func:`assert_reservations_balanced` -- every ``client_order_id``'s
       ledgered ``OrderTransitionLedgered`` history replays as a single legal
       state-machine chain from ``INTENT_CREATED``. This is the observable
       proxy for the Gateway's in-flight-closing "reservation" bookkeeping
       (issue #39/#40): every place where that in-memory tally is opened
       (an ``ACK`` transition) or released (``FILL``/``CANCEL``) is *also* a
       ledgered transition, so a reservation opened or released more than
       once (or out of sequence) necessarily leaves a corrupted per-coid
       chain -- the only durable, purely-external symptom such a bug can
       leave, since the tally itself is a private Gateway attribute this
       module never reaches into.

Every function here is pure: it reads only *public*, durable state -- the
ledger (:class:`~hedgekit.ledger.store.LedgerRecord`, the same source
:meth:`~hedgekit.order_gateway.gateway.OrderGateway.recover` and
:class:`~hedgekit.order_gateway.reconciler.Reconciler` fold), the write-ahead
log (:class:`~hedgekit.order_gateway.wal.WalRecord`, equally durable and
public via ``WriteAheadLog.read_all()``), and the venue's live truth
(:class:`~hedgekit.connector.models.OpenOrder`/``Position``, read exactly as
:meth:`~hedgekit.connector.paper.PaperExchange.get_open_orders`/
``get_positions`` return them). None ever reaches into a Gateway private
attribute (``_acks``, ``_tracked``, ``_inflight_closing``, ...).
