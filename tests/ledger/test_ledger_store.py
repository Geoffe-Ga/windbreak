"""Tests for `windbreak.ledger.store.SqliteLedgerStore` (issue #13, #75).

Pins the on-disk contract from SPEC §12: monotonically increasing
sequence numbers starting at 1, hash chaining from a fixed genesis
`prev_hash`, WAL journaling, exact round-trip of every persisted column,
and durability across a store close/reopen cycle -- since the ledger
must survive process restarts.

The `compute_event_hash` known-answer test is the mutation-killer for
the hashing formula itself: it independently recomputes the SHA-256
digest in the test body using the exact §12 concatenation and asserts
byte-for-byte equality with the production function's output.

The `head()` tests (issue #75) pin the read used by anchor-head
computation: the current chain head as a `ChainHead(sequence_number,
event_hash)`, or `None` for an empty ledger.

The rollback tests (issue #76) pin `append`'s transactional contract: a
failure injected between `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and `COMMIT` (via a monkeypatched
`compute_event_hash`) must propagate to the caller *and* leave the
transaction released, so the ledger is byte-for-byte unchanged and the next
append continues the chain normally. Today `append` has no
try/ROLLBACK, so the injected failure leaves the SQLite connection sitting
inside an un-released `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; the very next `append` call fails
with `sqlite3.OperationalError: cannot start a transaction within a
transaction` instead of succeeding -- that is the FAILING-for-the-right-reason
symptom these tests pin.

The commit-time rollback test (issue #76 hardening) drives the harder
*post-INSERT* case: it lets the SELECT-last read, `compute_event_hash`, and
the `INSERT` all run for real, then forces `COMMIT` *itself* to fail, pinning
that `append` still ROLLBACKs -- rather than COMMITs -- the already-inserted
row. A mutant swapping `append`'s except-clause `ROLLBACK` for `COMMIT` would
persist that row and so fail this test's snapshot-equality assertion.

Issue #235 (replay durable kill state on `windbreak run --process riskkernel`
startup) adds `events_from_records`, the read-side companion this module does
not yet define: reconstructing base `Event`s from persisted `LedgerRecord`s so
a rebuilt `RiskKernel`/`KillSwitch` can fold real ledger history. It does not
exist on the real, not-yet-updated `store.py` module yet, so importing it
below fails collection with `ImportError: cannot import name
'events_from_records' from 'windbreak.ledger.store'` -- the expected Gate 1
RED state for issue #235.
