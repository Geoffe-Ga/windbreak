"""Failing-first tests for the docker-compose skeleton (issue #15, RED).

`deploy/docker-compose.yml` does not exist yet, so every test in this module
fails at test-body time with `FileNotFoundError` when `_load_compose` tries
to open it. Once the deploy skeleton lands, these tests pin its structural
contract: exactly four services (one per SPEC process), each launching
`hedgekit run --process <token>` with `restart: on-failure`, a shared named
`ledger` volume mounted read-write on `pipeline` and read-only on
`dashboard`, no top-level `networks` override, and every published port
bound to `127.0.0.1` only (never the implicit `0.0.0.0`).
