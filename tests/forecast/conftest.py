"""Shared fixtures for windbreak.forecast tests (issue #22, SPEC S8.2 / S6.3).

`windbreak/forecast/` does not exist yet, so any test module in this directory
that imports from it fails collection with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module
named 'windbreak.forecast'` -- the expected Gate 1 RED state for issue #22.

Two deliberate fixture-design choices, both explained here because they shape
every test file in this package:

Fixture-construction choice (market / baseline)
    `NormalizedMarket` and `BaselineQuoteSnapshot` are constructed directly in
    Python (mirroring `tests/connector/test_models.py`'s `_VALID_KWARGS`
    pattern) rather than loaded from a JSON fixture file. Unlike
    `FakeExchange.from_fixture_dir`, `windbreak.forecast` has no existing
    "load a normalized model from a fixture directory" helper -- inventing one
    here would test fixture-loading plumbing that has nothing to do with
    issue #22's actual contract (the pipeline stages, the record schema, the
    cassette harness).

Cassette-fixture choice (populated replay cassette)
    The *populated* cassette used to prove "replay never touches the network"
    is deliberately NOT built from a static, pre-committed JSON file with
    hardcoded SHA-256 request hashes. `LlmRequest.request_hash()` is specified
    as "sha256 hex of canonical JSON of its fields", but the exact request
    *prompts* the not-yet-written pipeline stages construct are an
    implementation detail this test suite cannot see in advance -- a
    hand-computed hash baked into a committed fixture would be silently
    brittle to any wording change in the real implementation's prompts, for
    zero added confidence. Instead, `make_fake_vote_transport` below provides
    a factory for a deterministic, network-free transport double
    (`FakeVoteTransport`) that pipeline tests wrap in a `RecordingCassette`
    pointed at `tmp_path`, then reload with `ReplayCassette.from_path` -- so
    every hash is self-consistent by construction, regardless of what the real
    implementation's prompt text turns out to be. The two committed
    `tests/fixtures/forecast/*.json` files (`cassettes.json`,
    `cassettes_with_float.json`) are used only for narrow, hash-independent
    structural tests in `test_cassettes.py`: a successful load, a *guaranteed*
    miss (their keys are human-readable placeholders, never a real 64-char
    hex digest), and float-leaf rejection.

Sandbox-transport fixture choice (issue #24)
    `FixtureSearchTransport` / `FixtureFetchTransport` below are the
    `windbreak.forecast.sandbox` analogue of `FakeVoteTransport`: deterministic,
    network-free doubles for the `SearchTransport` / `FetchTransport`
    injection seams. `research_tools_factory` defers its
    `from windbreak.forecast.sandbox import build_research_tools` to call time
    (inside the returned closure, not at module import time) so this conftest
    module keeps collecting cleanly for every other `tests/forecast/*` module
    while `windbreak/forecast/sandbox.py` does not yet exist -- only a test that
    actually calls the factory (or the `research_tools` fixture) hits the
    `ModuleNotFoundError`, which is the expected Gate 1 RED state for
    issue #24.

Citation-verification fixture choice (issue #26)
    `RaisingFetchTransport` and `MutatingRefetchTransport` below are the
    `windbreak.forecast.citations` analogue of the sandbox doubles above:
    deterministic `FetchTransport` doubles shared by `test_citations.py`
    (unit-level `verify_citation` checks) and `test_abstention.py`
    (end-to-end `run_pipeline`/`run_triaged_pipeline` abstention checks), so
    both test modules pin the exact same fetch-failure and fetch-mutation
    shapes rather than each inventing a slightly different one. Both are
    exposed only through factory fixtures (`make_raising_fetch_transport`,
    `make_mutating_refetch_transport`) mirroring `make_fake_vote_transport`'s
    "the fixture body is literally the class" convention -- a fresh,
    independently-stateful double per test, never one shared instance.

Divergence-cassette fixture choice (issue #191)
    `DIVERGENT_VOTE_RESPONSES` and the `diverse_markets` fixture below back
    `test_vote_cassette_divergence.py`'s cross-market record/replay coverage:
    three distinct (`NormalizedMarket`, `BaselineQuoteSnapshot`) pairs -- a
    Fed-rate market, a weather market, and a presidential-election market --
    each paired with three hand-authored, schema-valid #184 vote JSON
    responses whose `probability_ppm` values diverge from each other and,
    for at least one member, from that market's own `baseline_ppm`
    (`price_pips * 100`) by more than 20_000 ppm. Unlike
    `CANNED_VOTE_RESPONSES` (chosen to reproduce one fixed baseline-derived
    sequence for a single market), these responses are deliberately varied
    per market so the divergence tests exercise the record/replay cassette
    harness under genuinely different vote content, not just a different
    market shell wrapped around identical votes. Exactly one response in the
    whole mapping carries `"abstain": true`, exercising that schema branch
    end-to-end through the cassette harness.

    Issue #26's `bounded_web_research` (pipeline stage 5) fetches each
    subquestion's candidate URL exactly once to build its `Citation` -- the
    content hash and quoted text baked into that citation come from that one
    fetch. `windbreak.forecast.citations.verify_citation` then *refetches* the
    same URL through `tools.fetch` to independently recompute the content
    hash, so a citation whose backing URL returns *different* content on that
    second call is guaranteed to fail with a content-hash mismatch. This
    double exploits that exact double-fetch shape (one fetch to build, one
    refetch to verify) so an *end-to-end pipeline run* -- not just a
    unit-level `verify_citation` call -- yields a fully deterministic,
    predetermined count of verified citations.

    Distinct URLs are remembered in first-seen order (the order
    `bounded_web_research` discovers them in -- one per subquestion, via
    `FixtureSearchTransport`), tracked in an explicit list rather than relying
    on any dict/set iteration order. The first `stable_urls` distinct URLs
    behave exactly like `FixtureFetchTransport`: *every* fetch of one of
    them -- first, second, or any later one -- returns the same deterministic
    `f"fixture content for {url}"` string, so their citations verify cleanly
    forever. Every other (later-discovered) distinct URL returns that same
    stable content on its *first* fetch only (so the citation stage 5 builds
    from that fetch is itself internally self-consistent: its stored content
    hash matches its own first-fetch content), but returns different,
    fetch-count-tagged content on every subsequent fetch of that same URL --
    so `verify_citation`'s refetch-and-rehash always mismatches for it.

    Net effect, given the package's fixed three-subquestion decomposition: a

#: Hand-authored, schema-valid #184 vote JSON responses per divergence-test
#: market (issue #191), keyed by ticker. Each market's three responses carry
#: mutually distinct `probability_ppm` values, and at least one diverges from
#: that market's own `baseline_ppm` (`price_pips * 100`) by more than 20_000
#: ppm. Exactly one response across the whole mapping (the elections market's
#: third vote) carries `"abstain": true`, exercising that schema branch
#: end-to-end through the cassette harness.
