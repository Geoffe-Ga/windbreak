"""Cross-market vote-divergence coverage for the LLM cassette harness (#191).

Drives `run_pipeline` over three genuinely different markets (a Fed-rate
market, a weather market, and a presidential-election market -- see
`tests/forecast/conftest.py`'s `diverse_markets` fixture and
`DIVERGENT_VOTE_RESPONSES` constant), each wired to a `FakeVoteTransport`
returning three hand-authored, mutually-diverging vote responses wrapped in a
`RecordingCassette`, then replayed twice through `ReplayCassette` -- pinning
that the record/replay harness stays fully deterministic even when the three
ensemble votes actually disagree with each other and with the market
baseline (not just when they happen to be close, as the pre-#191
`test_pipeline_skeleton.py` coverage exercises with a single fixed market).

Each surviving vote's provenance is checked against the new #191 pinned
vote-ensemble triple (`windbreak.forecast.providers.DEFAULT_VOTE_ENSEMBLE`
and its config-schema mirror) -- today that ensemble is still the pre-#191
triple, so this module's provenance assertions fail with an `AssertionError`
naming the mismatched provider/model_version/training_cutoff, not a
collection error, the expected Gate 1 RED state for issue #191.

A separate, single fail-closed test drives the same default market/baseline
fixtures over `ForbiddenLiveTransport`, proving the vote stage is actually
reached (the transport really is called) yet never completes a live call.
That test exercises an already-guaranteed structural invariant (no new
production code is required for it to pass), so it is included as
regression coverage locking in behavior this issue must not break, not as a
RED pin.
