"""Tests for windbreak.forecast.pipeline (issue #22): the SPEC S8.2 stub wiring.

Pins the four issue-mandated pipeline behaviors: (a) a schema-valid
`ForecastRecord` comes out the other end, (b) identical inputs produce
byte-identical output, (c) the output record is truly immutable, and (d)
replaying over a `ForbiddenLiveTransport` with a fully-populated cassette
completes purely from recorded responses while an empty cassette fails closed
with `CassetteMissError` -- never a live fallback. `windbreak/forecast/` does
not exist yet, so importing `windbreak.forecast.pipeline` fails collection with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'windbreak.forecast'` -- the expected
Gate 1 RED state for issue #22.

Also pins the issue #184 vote-parsing seam directly on `collect_model_votes`:
vote probabilities must come from the *response* (a structured, integer-ppm
JSON vote), never from `baseline ± fixed offset`; a response whose
`probability_ppm` is not a true integer is discarded and ledgered exactly
like an injection-tainted response; and an explicit `ensemble` override
threads its members' provenance onto the resulting votes. Until issue #184
lands, `collect_model_votes` has no `ensemble` keyword, `windbreak.forecast.
sanitize` has no `RESPONSE_FAILURE_NON_INTEGER_PROBABILITY` constant, and
`windbreak.config.schema` has no `EnsembleMemberConfig` -- so the three tests
in the "vote probability comes from the response" section below import those
two new names *locally* (deferred to call time, mirroring
`tests/forecast/conftest.py`'s "Sandbox-transport fixture choice" pattern) so
this module keeps collecting cleanly for every pre-existing test above; only
those three new tests themselves fail, with an `ImportError` naming the
missing symbol or (once the symbols exist) a `TypeError` on the still-missing
`ensemble=` keyword -- the expected Gate 1 RED state for issue #184.
