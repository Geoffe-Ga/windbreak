"""Tests for prompt-injection defense (issue #27, SPEC S8.5, threat T1).

Pins the SPEC S8.5 contract across two layers:

1. **The ten-fixture poisoned-page corpus** -- a page carrying a direct
   instruction override, a fake tool-call lure, a role-impersonation turn, a
   hidden-CSS payload, a `<script>` payload, an oversized-quote demand, a
   citation-URL spoof, or a forged closing delimiter either (a) never leaks
   past the 25-word quote window and produces a record byte-identical to a
   clean run once citation content leaves are masked ("full"), or (b) gets
   caught by independent re-verification and the pipeline abstains before
   ever touching the vote transport ("abstain") -- there is no third outcome.
   Every case, regardless of outcome, is also checked for tool-allowlist
   discipline (only `research.local` is ever fetched; a malicious URL
   embedded *inside* a poisoned page's text is never itself dereferenced) and
   cache-write discipline (only raw bytes land under the sandboxed cache
   dir).
2. **The response-side defenses** -- `windbreak.forecast.sanitize`'s
   `sanitize_content` / `extract_quote` / `wrap_data_block` /
   `validate_vote_response`, and `windbreak.forecast.pipeline`'s new
   discard-and-ledger contract: a single model vote that itself tries a
   delimiter forgery or a tool-call lure is thrown away (never silently
   trusted, never causing a privileged retry) and ledgered with a
   fingerprint-only payload; if every vote is thrown away, the run abstains
   with `ABSTENTION_ALL_VOTES_DISCARDED` rather than aggregating over zero
   votes.

`windbreak/forecast/sanitize.py` does not exist yet, and
`windbreak/forecast/pipeline.py` does not yet export `ForecastEvent`,
`InMemoryForecastLedger`, `FORECAST_OUTPUT_DISCARDED_EVENT`,
`ABSTENTION_ALL_VOTES_DISCARDED`, or the new
`quotes`/`ledger` keywords on `collect_model_votes` and `run_pipeline`, so
importing them below fails collection with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module
named 'windbreak.forecast.sanitize'` (or an `ImportError` naming a missing
pipeline symbol) -- the expected Gate 1 RED state for issue #27.

Corpus-fixture design choice
    Each `corpus/*.html` fixture is a *plain string* payload (per this
    package's `conftest.py` docstring), not necessarily well-formed HTML: a
    "full"-expected case's clean lead and attack payload are ordinary prose
    with no markup at all (so `sanitize_content`'s fast identity path -- no
    `<` -- applies and the quote is trivially a raw substring), while an
    "abstain"-expected case embeds exactly the one
    HTML construct (a hidden `<div>`, a `<script>` block, or a literal
    delimiter token) its category needs to exercise, and nothing else. This
    keeps every fixture's expected outcome a direct, traceable consequence of
    the documented `sanitize_content` behavior rather than an artifact of
    incidental markup this suite does not control.
