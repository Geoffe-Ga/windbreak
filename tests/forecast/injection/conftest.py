"""Shared doubles/loaders for the SPEC S8.5 prompt-injection corpus (issue #27).

`hedgekit/forecast/sanitize.py` does not exist yet, and `hedgekit/forecast/pipeline.py`
does not yet export the ledgering/quote-threading symbols this package's tests
need (`ForecastEvent`, `InMemoryForecastLedger`, the `quotes`/`ledger` keywords
on `collect_model_votes` and `run_pipeline`, ...), so any test module in this
package that imports them fails collection with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module
named 'hedgekit.forecast.sanitize'` (or an `ImportError` naming the missing
pipeline symbol) -- the expected Gate 1 RED state for issue #27.

This conftest inherits every fixture from `tests/forecast/conftest.py`
(`market`, `baseline`, `created_at`, `research_tools_factory`,
`research_tools`, `make_fake_vote_transport`, `FixtureSearchTransport`,
`FixtureFetchTransport`) automatically via pytest's directory-scoped conftest
resolution -- none of them are redefined here.

Six new doubles are added, each network-free and deterministic, mirroring the
parent conftest's "the fixture body is literally the class, exposed through a
`make_*` factory fixture" convention:

* `PoisonedFetchTransport` -- serves one fixed page (a corpus fixture's raw
  bytes) for *every* URL and *every* refetch, so a citation built from it
  always self-verifies against a stable second fetch (the same shape
  `MutatingRefetchTransport`'s `stable_urls` slots rely on in
  `test_abstention.py`, just simplified to "every URL is stable").
* `LoggingSearchTransport` / `LoggingFetchTransport` -- transparent recording
  wrappers around an inner transport, so a test can assert on the exact
  queries/URLs a pipeline run touched without the transport double itself
  needing to know anything about assertions.
* `PromptRecordingTransport` -- the `LlmTransport`-side analogue: wraps an
  inner vote transport (typically a `FakeVoteTransport` from the parent
  conftest) and records every `LlmRequest.prompt` plus a call count, so
  prompt-hygiene tests can inspect exactly what stage 8 sent upstream.
* `MaliciousVoteTransport` -- returns an injected tool-call-lure response at
  chosen zero-based vote indices (canned-valid text otherwise), for the
  discard-and-ledger tests.
* `MappingFetchTransport` -- per-URL content, for the mixed-scenario test
  (one poisoned URL among otherwise-clean ones).

`corpus_page` is a loader fixture (not a transport double): given a filename,
it returns that `tests/forecast/injection/corpus/*.html` fixture's raw text,
read fresh on every call so a test can hand the exact same bytes to both a
`PoisonedFetchTransport` and its own "expected raw content" assertions.
