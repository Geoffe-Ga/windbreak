"""Tests for windbreak.connector.semantics (issue #18): the BalanceSemantics contract.

`windbreak/connector/semantics.py` does not exist yet, so importing it fails
collection with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'windbreak.connector.semantics'` -- the expected Gate 1 RED state for issue #18.

Pins: each of the eight SPEC-required semantics enums carries an explicit
`UNKNOWN` member (never inferred, never silently defaulted); the exact member
set per enum; `BalanceSemantics.is_fully_known()`'s per-field boolean logic;
and the eight recorded Kalshi field values (five KNOWN, three UNKNOWN) that
back the venue's evidence table in
`tests/fixtures/exchange/kalshi/README.md`.
