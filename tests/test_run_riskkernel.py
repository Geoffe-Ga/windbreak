"""Failing-first tests wiring RiskKernel + KillIntegration into `windbreak run`
(issue #144, RED).

The kill switch (`KillSwitch`, `KillFileWatcher`, `ReconciliationMismatchMonitor`,
`KillIntegration` in `windbreak/riskkernel/kill.py`) is fully built and tested
(issue #35), but `windbreak/main.py` never composes it into the live
`windbreak run --process riskkernel` process -- that invocation still runs the
bare `run_loop` heartbeat, so a running deployment's `windbreak kill` writes a
`KILL` file no running kernel polls. `windbreak.main._build_risk_kernel` does
not exist yet, so every import below fails collection with
`ImportError: cannot import name '_build_risk_kernel' from 'windbreak.main'`
-- the expected Gate 1 RED state for issue #144.

Once `_build_risk_kernel` and its `_run_riskkernel` CLI routing land, this
file pins: a KILL file dropped into `ops.state_dir` actually halts a kernel
built by `_build_risk_kernel` (AC#2, no HTTP/dashboard involved); the real
`windbreak kill` CLI verb engages that same kernel end-to-end (AC#3); `windbreak
run --process riskkernel` routes to the real `RiskKernel` (proven by its
`heartbeat beat=N` log shape, distinct from `run_loop`'s `heartbeat seq=N`) and
its post-run shutdown line; a state directory that cannot be created fails
closed with a `FATAL` critical log and zero heartbeats (never entering the
kernel loop); `RiskConfig.kill_after_consecutive_mismatches` is threaded from
config into the wired `ReconciliationMismatchMonitor`, auto-killing the *shared*
mode machine both the kernel and the kill switch read; and the CLI's float
`--heartbeat-interval` is accepted and mapped onto the kernel's integer-seconds
`run(heartbeat_interval=...)` without raising.

Every test builds its own `WindbreakConfig` via `dataclasses.replace` over a
`tmp_path`-rooted `OpsConfig.state_dir`, and every CLI-level test that reads a
YAML `--config` file points `ops.state_dir` at a `tmp_path` too -- so no test
in this module ever touches the real `~/.local/share/windbreak`, where a KILL
file dropped by a previous manual run or a concurrent test process could
otherwise pollute this or a developer's environment.

Issue #235 (replay durable kill state on `windbreak run --process riskkernel`
startup) extends this module with the `--ledger-path` half of the story:
`_build_risk_kernel` gains a keyword-only `ledger_store` parameter that, when
given, persists kernel events to the real ledger (via a new
`PersistingKernelLedgerWriter`) and replays durable override/kill state from
it via `RiskKernel.from_events`/`KillSwitch.from_events` -- so an engaged kill
survives a `windbreak run --process riskkernel` restart even after its
belt-and-suspenders `KILL` file is deleted. None of this exists on the real,
not-yet-updated `windbreak/main.py` yet: `_build_risk_kernel(config,
ledger_store=...)` fails with `TypeError: _build_risk_kernel() got an
unexpected keyword argument 'ledger_store'`, and every persistence/replay
assertion below fails instead as a plain `AssertionError` against today's
`LoggingKernelLedgerWriter`-only, replay-free behavior -- both are the
expected Gate 1 RED state for issue #235, independent of (and in addition to)
whatever issue #144's tests above already pin.

Issue #236 (wire a `ReadOnlyVerifier` into the live composition, making the
`AUTO_RECONCILIATION` auto-kill trigger live rather than composed-but-dormant)
extends this module further: `_build_risk_kernel` gains a keyword-only
`verification_connector: MarketConnector | None = None` that, when supplied,
wires a `StartupBaselineExpectationSource` (over that same connector) and a
`ReadOnlyVerifier` -- sharing the kernel's ledger writer and the kill switch's
`AlertDispatcher` -- through to `RiskKernel.from_events(verifier=...)`; and
`_drive_risk_kernel` builds a `FakeExchange.from_fixture_dir` connector from
`args.snapshot_fixture_dir` (when given) inside its existing fail-closed
`try`. None of this exists on the real, not-yet-updated `windbreak/main.py`
yet: `_build_risk_kernel(config, verification_connector=...)` fails with
`TypeError: _build_risk_kernel() got an unexpected keyword argument
'verification_connector'`, and the `--snapshot-fixture-dir` CLI-level
assertions fail instead as plain `AssertionError`s (zero `Verification*`
events recorded, or a fail-closed exit code of `0` instead of `1`) against
today's connector-less, snapshot-fixture-dir-ignoring composition -- both are
the expected Gate 1 RED state for issue #236, independent of (and in addition
to) issues #144 and #235's tests above.
