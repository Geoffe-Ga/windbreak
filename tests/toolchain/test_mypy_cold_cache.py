"""Failing-first tests pinning the Gate-2 mypy cold-cache-parity contract.

Issue #179: `scripts/typecheck.sh` currently lets mypy write its
incremental on-disk cache to the default, persistent `.mypy_cache/`
directory at the repo root, and every local invocation reuses whatever
that directory already contains. CI, by contrast, always starts from an
empty cache (a fresh checkout has no `.mypy_cache/`). Because mypy's
incremental mode remembers which modules it already resolved certain
cross-module facts for -- notably `no-implicit-reexport` and
`attr-defined` -- a warm local cache can silently green a run that a
genuinely cold cache (i.e. what CI actually runs) would fail on. That
makes Gate 1 (`./scripts/check-all.sh`) a false-positive for exactly the
class of error CI is supposed to catch.

The target fix (implemented in a later step, not by this test module):
before invoking `mypy`, `scripts/typecheck.sh` sets
`MYPY_CACHE_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"`, `export`s it (mypy reads
`MYPY_CACHE_DIR` from its process environment when no explicit
`--cache-dir` flag is passed), and registers `trap 'rm -rf
"$MYPY_CACHE_DIR"' EXIT` so the per-run temp directory is always cleaned
up, regardless of how the script exits. The literal invocation `mypy
windbreak/ scripts/` -- separately pinned in lockstep with the
pre-commit mypy hook's scope by
`tests/toolchain/test_precommit_scope.py` -- must stay byte-identical;
this module re-asserts that substring so a cache-dir fix that
accidentally mangles the command also fails loudly here.

These assertions begin life as Gate 1 RED: the unmodified
`scripts/typecheck.sh` has none of the `MYPY_CACHE_DIR` / `mktemp -d` /
`export` / `trap ... EXIT` mechanism, so the static source-assertion
tests below fail against the present script. The behavioral test may
also fail RED today, because the unmodified script lets mypy create (or
touch) the repo-root `.mypy_cache/` directory rather than isolating its
cache away from it.

    Positive-detection regression for issue #179. The cold-cache fix alone is
    inert on this bug class: `no-implicit-reexport` is a `--strict`-only check,
    and `scripts/typecheck.sh` runs the *bare* command `mypy windbreak/
    scripts/`, taking its strictness solely from pyproject.toml's `[tool.mypy]`.
    Empirically, before this fix that config passed cleanly on a real implicit
    re-export (cold cache made no difference), so the #158/#178 pattern still
    false-greened locally and only failed CI's separate `--strict` pre-commit
    step -- the exact recurrence #179 targets.

    This test reproduces that pattern in an isolated fixture package and runs
    mypy exactly as the fixed Gate-2 path does -- config-driven (via the repo's
    real `pyproject.toml`, no explicit `--strict` flag) and cold
    (`--no-incremental`, no shared cache) -- then asserts mypy *rejects* it. The
    fixture is fully typed, so the implicit re-export is the only possible
    error: `via` imports `VALUE` without explicitly re-exporting it, and
    `consumer` imports `VALUE` through `via`, which `--no-implicit-reexport`
    flags as `[attr-defined]`. If a future edit drops `strict = true` from the
