"""Failing-first tests pinning the detect-secrets enforcement-parity contract.

Issue #262 closes an enforcement-parity gap: `scripts/security.sh` --
the script `./scripts/check-all.sh` (Gate 1) actually invokes -- only runs
`detect-secrets scan .` inside an `if $FULL; then ... fi` block, guarded on
`command -v detect-secrets` being present, and the result is discarded with
`|| true`. `check-all.sh` calls `security.sh` with no `--full` flag (see
`run_check "Security checks" "security.sh"`), so on every local Gate 1 run
and in CI's `check-all.sh` invocation, detect-secrets never runs at all --
and even when it is run manually with `--full`, its exit code is thrown
away, so a leaked secret would never fail the check. Meanwhile the
`detect-secrets` pre-commit hook (`Yelp/detect-secrets`, `.pre-commit-
config.yaml`) *does* enforce a `.secrets.baseline` diff on every commit, so
today's "protection" only exists at the pre-commit layer -- a layer
developers can skip with `--no-verify` and CI's `check-all.sh` step never
re-checks.

The target state: `scripts/security.sh` runs `pre-commit run detect-secrets
--all-files` unconditionally (not gated behind `--full`, not silenced with
`|| true`, not soft-gated behind `command -v detect-secrets`), delegating to
the exact same Yelp/detect-secrets hook -- and therefore the exact same
`.secrets.baseline` -- that pre-commit already enforces. This makes
`check-all.sh` (Gate 1) and pre-commit enforce detect-secrets identically:
whatever passes/fails locally via pre-commit passes/fails identically via
`./scripts/check-all.sh`, with no `--full` opt-in required and no swallowed
exit code. A failure must also point the developer at `.secrets.baseline`
with remediation guidance that does not amount to "just regenerate the
baseline" (which would silently launder a real secret into the allowlist).

These assertions began life as Gate 1 RED for issue #262: `scripts/
security.sh`'s current source contains no `pre-commit run detect-secrets
--all-files` invocation, still guards its (non-enforcing) detect-secrets
call behind `if $FULL`, still runs the swallowed-exit-code `detect-secrets
scan . || true` behind a soft `command -v detect-secrets` gate, and carries
no user-facing `.secrets.baseline` remediation message at all. Test 1 below
is the sole exception: it pins the pre-commit hook's existing, already-
correct baseline-enforcing configuration as a lockstep anchor, and is green
today and expected to stay green -- it exists to prove the hook that
`security.sh` will delegate to is itself baseline-enforcing, not to pin a
gap.
