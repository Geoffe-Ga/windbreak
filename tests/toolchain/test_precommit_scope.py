"""Failing-first tests pinning the pre-commit mypy-scope lockstep contract.

Issue #68 closes a content-debt gap: the pre-commit `mypy` hook is scoped
via `files: ^windbreak/`, which silently excludes `scripts/` from every
pre-commit run even though `scripts/typecheck.sh` -- the entry point
developers and CI both invoke directly -- also only type-checks
`windbreak/`. Nothing forces the two to agree, so a future change to one
scope can drift from the other without either check failing.

The target state: the mypy hook scopes type-checking via explicit
directory `args` (`windbreak/` and `scripts/`) plus `pass_filenames: false`
(so pre-commit never appends individually staged filenames on top of the
directory args), retaining `files:` only as a run-trigger that skips the
hook when no matching file changed. `scripts/typecheck.sh` runs the literal
command `mypy windbreak/ scripts/`. Because both sides are asserted against
each other's literal scope, any future edit that touches one is forced to
touch the other or this test breaks -- that is what "lockstep" means here.

Separately, issue #68 also requires the three whitespace-mangling
pre-commit hooks (`trailing-whitespace`, `end-of-file-fixer`,
`mixed-line-ending`) to `exclude` `scripts/ralph/state.json`, since that
file is machine-written orchestration state whose exact bytes the ralph
tooling depends on.

These assertions began life as Gate 1 RED (the mypy hook was scoped via
`files: ^windbreak/` with no `scripts/` arg and no `pass_filenames: false`,
`scripts/typecheck.sh` only ran `mypy windbreak/`, and none of the three
whitespace hooks declared an `exclude` key). They now pass and stand as the
regression guard that keeps the widened scope and the state-file excludes in
place -- any future edit that drifts one side of the lockstep breaks them.
